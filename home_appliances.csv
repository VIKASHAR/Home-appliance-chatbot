Good for winter times to boil the water Bass fitting loose Good product no issue after using 2months Good matereal Only disadvantage is the cord length.,Somehow Amazon sucks when you want to select an electric kettle. There are no options to filter your choices based on the parameters that matter. It is easy to fall into the trap of an ongoing deal and end up buying something that falls short of what you need. In this review I will answer your questions about the PIGEON AMAZE PLUS 1.5L ELECTRIC KETTLE.1. Can I trust the reviews for this ad Are they genuine Probably yes. But know that the seller lists several types of PIGEON Kettles in the same ad. Unless the review refers to this particular model you could well end up seeing a review of a product and buying a different one. The ratings are also an aggregated mix. There could be 10 negative review of the product you are seeing and 10 positives for the other products. The page will show you a neutral review. That s the game sellers are playing these days to avoid negative reviews. I have posted a picture of the stove I am referring to in this review.2. WATTAGE: Important because this tells how quickly the water will heat up. This one is 1500W meaning that you can switch it on ... brush your teeth and find the water is boiled. Great time saving My earlier one was 900W and it used to take 10 15 minutes of patient waiting. The gas stove boiled water faster. This one takes about 3 4 mins to heat 2 mugs of coffee3. CABLE LENGTH: Most of these kettle makers skimp on the cable length. I have purchased kettles to find they have only a 2 foot long cable ... and I had to return them. This one has cable length of 22 slightly more than one meter which is allows a comfortable distance between the kettle and the plug.4. CONNECTOR: This one uses a 6A plug which is most common in India. Be careful because from 1500W onwards most kettles use a 16A plug and that is not always available at the place where you want to place the kettle. Strictly speaking it should have a 16A plug but then this is kept on for short intervals only.5. CAPACITY: 1.7 litres as mentioned though I could not see markings for max and min levels. This is good enough to make 4 5 decent sized mugs of coffee6. COOKING OTHER STUFF: The ad says only water but I see no reason why you cannot heat Maggi etc. Maybe you can. But avoid milk as the expanding effect will cause spills and this can have adverse effects.7. LOOKS: Quite okay for the price. It will not make your kitchen look bad and neither will it enhance the looks. This is the most common look that an electric kettle can have.8. PERFORMANCE: I have used for 2 days only. No complaints so far. There is a 1 year guarantee card accompanying the product9. HANDLE: Very convenient feel when you lift it it from the heating cradle. Does not feel very heavy even if there is a full 1.7L of water.10. NEGATIVES: This is a steel jug. The outside will automatically heat up. If you are used to a plastic outside in your previous kettle you need to be a little careful.VERDICT BUY at the time of writing this review this costs less than Rs 700. I have seen that sellers tend to inflate prices as they get my positive reviews therefore I am also mentioning the price range based on which I gave this product a 5 star review The body is very lightweight and doesn t feel sturdy. Does the job of heating water fast and that s it. Cord length could be a little longer. The plastic parts doesn t feels sturdy. The top cap has a smaller dia so a man s hand has a trouble fitting it inside the container during cleaning and can easily cut our hands. Overall it s okay. Its quality was not too much good light quality product but according to price its okay.Easy to use product good for save time. Good product for boiling water. shock proof. So no worries.hahaha Cattle bass fitting not currently Good product Go for it Amazing product.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/31na34LxwmL.

It takes a very long time for thick vessels to heat up before you can start cooking.As a primary cooking appliance this doesn t suit as it s very time consuming. Can be used for keeping things hot or slow boiling milk etc.Also had to request a warranty repair. The request was served within 2 days. The contact information is present on the warranty card. Just received it. Though the product looks new there are few scratches here and there making me unhappy.Compared its performance with other induction cook top that I have with same amount of water at same temperature in the same vessel .Sadly this cook top is a tad slow to boil compared to the old one.But I think that is okay because the old one which I have is Rs. 1000 more than this one.

My needs are fulfilled. Thank you. Good product Product looks good but Boiling milk in this kettle burns the base of the kettle it becomes full black and brown And eggs don t get boiled in a single go . Nice product After 2 months of usage some issues have come up. Once it gets to the boiling point it should automatically switch off but it keeps on bubbling till it is switched off manually. Next is that the water vapors and heat can be felt through the kettle on/off switch which I believe is dangerous. We ordered this trusting Prestige to be of high quality but it doesn t satisfy the purpose. After using only one month kettle on /off switch is not working and red light is also not working.Some times it s boiling time is too fast and some times too slow.

Good product Very good product and life saver in winters Easy to use Solve the problem of lint on woollen fabrics,The lint remover actually removes the lint : . It is not a gimmick but an actual working machine. it gives new life to the winter clothes which were of no use due to heavy lint all around. Using this small machine you can remove lint and see the difference. I used it on 2 3 clothes and am very happy with the result. Let me describe the pros and cons:Pros:1. Very easy to use2. Removes any kind of lint3. it also removes lint that is not visible i.e. of the same color which gives rough look to the cloth making it look older. so your clothes look a bit like the new ones.4. lint is collected in a container that is easy to cleanCons:1. The process is very very slow. you need to move the machine on the cloth surface a number of times.2. the build quality is plasticky like cheap toys. it may break if fallen on a hard surface.3. the cable length is very small. The plug comes off the socket easily. you need to sit very close to the socket making it a bit difficult to use sometimes.4. the lint collector comes off very often5. the rotor blades make a weird noise as if they are going to break.6. the BIGGEST PROBLEM is that you need to sit for prolonged periods to make your clothes lint free which strains your neck badly and if you are suffering from cervical then forget it. you will use it once and will never touch it again. however you can make an arrangement to hang the clothes on a wall hanger and remove lint by keeping your neck straight.other than that it is a good product and can be tried.Thanks product is good overall working fine but the seller should pack it more carefully as i received the upper detachable part in a broken condition as it is non replaceable makes it more difficult for the customer but coming to the working part the product quality is good wotks fina and removes everything easily.a must buy product for winter. I have used a similar product earlier but this one works better and size is also very effective using is very ergonomic and like I said does the job well. Come with a small brush to bruah off samll residue on the fabric. Would recommend buying this. Delivery and packaging was good too. Easy to clean easy to use. Does the job. Received the product fast and in perfect condition. There is a leaflet inside promising 6month warranty. If it provides that it s teh perfect product for this price. This is very product it cleans all lint from my woolen clothes but it have 1dislike store area is very less and slim it have problem for cleaning store area and the product is very good This is very good.

All good Good product. Worthy product to buy. Easy to install. Nice product and good service,Worth the penny:Used for 2 days on time delivery next day installation by havells and every good installation support from havells.Water gets heating within 5 mins and you have to open half tap for continuous flow of hot water. Sufficient for bucket bathing and the good part is heating indication. One thing is missing in the geyser is Temp control but overall Best in this price range 3 ltrs . The product was delivered on time and as promised by Amazon.Upon receiving the water heater I received a text from Havells for the installation of the product. The installation process was smooth apart from the fact that one needs to purchase a 16A three pin socket wall plug not included with the water heater . There are no installation charges and my only gripe with the water heater is no plug The water heats up very quickly 5 mins approx. and retains temperature for good 4 hours. Light indicators show heat stages Heating or Heated Even though one will find many alternatives at better prices additional costs for installation and accessories should be taken into account.Bonus marks for getting the design correct. It s compact yet efficient. Does its job well. I expected a bit quicker heating though. Installation guy came the very next day. All the accessories required was provided in the package. But light is not working not within 2 weeks Easy to install. Value for money. Its a good product in terms of usability easy to useAll in all its a great Instant geyser product with this price range.

We really enjoy the product If your place is air tight this 9 fin Radiotor heater will be enough. But my place is not air tight that s why I am not satisfied. Product could use a user manual.Number of fins required for so and so size of rooms needs to be described Can not working. We are just using it without fan. Don t have patience for exchange/return now. Overall good Good 9 Fin Oil Filler Room Heater from Morphy Richards. Reduced one star as there is no PTC Fan in this. Remaining all features working as expected. Good product. Used 10 kWh unit electricity for full night run in Agra with min temperature at 7degrees. Keeps the small 10x10 foot room warm enough to be able to sit in light jacket.Heats up room slowly as expected unlike coil based heaters. But less danger and doesn t impact skin.Easy to setup the rollers.For a bigger room go for 11fins model and not 9 fins model. People who are saying that screws didn t come. Please check under lower thermocol. Screws are there. I raised return request bought new Morphy richards from store and found this thing. So cancelled the return request. I got 2 now because of this issue.

Need to buy another socket of 16amp to make this product usable. Otherwise it will be of no use. Nice product. It warm the 1 bucket water in 5m. Branded and good quality I have used this product twice since the purchase and it s good. The cord length can be increased more so that it will be easy to use. The water is getting heated in a short span of time. There is a minimum and maximum marking on the heater and the heater should be immersed inside the water till the minimum markings compulsaryly.. so if u are going to heat a half bucket of water it won t be used.

Philips GC1905 1440 Watt Steam Iron with Spray Blue,Home Kitchen Kitchen HomeAppliances Vacuum Cleaning Ironing Irons Steamers Accessories Irons SteamIrons,1 614,1 745,8%,4.3,37 974,To Prevent Water Leakage keep the iron horizontal when not in use do not fill water completely leave some gap and wait for some time for the iron to heat up before using the iron Easy and super fast filling of the watertank Easy and super fast emptying of the watertank A fine spray evenly moistens the fabric Continuous steam output up to 13 g/min Aluminium soleplate for easy gliding on all fabrics Warranty: 2 years on product Power: 1440 watts Power Input: 240V and Frequency: 50 Hz Water tank capacity: 180ml Power cord length: 1.8m Calc clean solution: Self clean Knob should always be at no steam position when product is not in use. Second and third setting is used only when soleplate is hot. Otherwise leakage will happen Size Name: Free Size,Neeraj Vishwakarma Pushpendra Singh Patel Sanjeev Ydv ESHAN GARG Arvind niharika Parvesh Amazon Customer,How to choose an iron This one A decent combo of features price.Cable quality not good though. Quality Iron for power users with effective spray steam function Review Guide Tips Doesn t remove hard wrinkles. Easyto use but it leaks water Very easy to use Good product Quick warm up Not good,Update as on 28.10.2018: The power cord has developed twists beyond repair and the seperate cores are now visible the insulation pvc of the cores doesn t look very durable.I don t know why such standard manufacturers can t provide a decent durable cable The iron however is performing flawlessly.Still disappointed as in coming weeks i ll have to change the cable for sure.Reducing one star for compromising upon the cable quality by such a big brand name.HOW IT STARTED THE NEED FOR AN IRON:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxRecently my previous Bajaj make dry iron which I received as a gift from somewhere started giving problems after two years of occasional use with not so careful handling and care . Initially Its wires insulation inside was found rotten around the iron entry point which I repaired myself and later its thermostat started giving problems. Finally its ON indication went OFF and I decided that it was time to bid goodbye to it and find a new one.Hence my search for a reputed brand make best value for money device began .Being from Electrical Engineering background occupation I fairly summed up my expectations from the power device as below:1. DRY IRON VS STEAM IRON :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThis was fairly simple if we consider the explanation that a steam iron could perform as a dry iron but vice versa was not possible. Also almost always you find some or the other stubborn wrinkles and crease distortions that is hard for the dry iron to overcome and you need to use water for the purpose.On the contrary As the steam loosens the individual fibres of the clothes the steam iron s pressing action smooths out wrinklesHence it was better to be equipped with the facility in the first place in the device itself.2. BRAND REPUTATION WARRANTY:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAs an average consumer We are not wrong in generally assuming that products of bigger established brands have a higher quality and perform better. Rightfully so A brand which has been working with a product for decades has a plenty of experience research regarding the possible points of failures of the product and can be surely trusted upon.Following the same footprints I thought not to take bets upon power devices like iron and go with the Super brands like Philips having decades of expertise in this field..Our product comes with a two year global warranty which is quite decent in my opinion .3. STEAM OUTPUT STEAM BURST VERTICAL STEAM FEATURE:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxDuring normal usage with steam a delivery of anything above 8 grams/min is okay but Some ironing jobs such as curtains or quilts require a much more supply of steam. In such cases the steam burst feature comes in handy. Users can push a button to receive a burst of steam when needed. More holes in the sole plate add to the effectiveness of steam supplied.Vertical steam feature in theory can direct clouds of steam in and around vertically hung garments or curtains which eliminates wrinkles without the need for a pressing force.However in practical scenario and by virtue of its design and water tank limitations a steam iron is virtually incapable of addressing the wrinkles like that and hence paying more for such a feature is not advised.Use dedicated garment steamers for that purpose. Our Philips GC1905 comes with a variable setting for steam output with a continuous delivery of up to 17 grams/min which is quite good.Additionally It can provide steam burst too for stubborn wrinkles. Vertical steam feature is not available though.4. ELECTRICAL RELATED FEATURES: WATTAGE CORD THERMOSTAT etc.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe simple maths that more watts means more heat or more steam or quick heating is not as simple as it looks.1. Surely more watts means more heat generated but more wattage limits our ability to plug the iron at any socket in the house as for any power above 1500 Watts I would suggest to only plug in to the power sockets.Going for more power demands must be backed up with careful examination as to whether you really need that much heating if its normal clothes only that you need to iron most of the times.2. Surely More heat developed is capable to deliver more steam but that depends upon the number of holes in your sole plate for it to be really effective Your water holding tank size and lastly steam delivery settings.Generating too much steam without delivery can be dangerous as it can pressurize the system.3. Last but not the least More power doesn t always mean quick heating as heating of the sole plate depends upon a number of factors like the material thickness of the sole plate Surface area of the heating element used inside the soleplate etc.Most of these intricate details are variable in nature and cannot be specifically mentioned by the manufacturer. OUR PRODUCT: Comes with a decent 1440 Watts of power good enough for routine casual use along with occasional use on heavier fabrics. Comes with a 250 Volts 10 Amp Max. rating of plug is always extra to actual amperage 3 pin Top which can be easily plugged into our casual 6 amp sockets as well without any damage to the socket.Hence enhanced mobility performance. The cord length is around 1.8 meters which is good enough for any practical lengths Any more than that would be cumbersome to handle.. The cord is braided with an insulated cotton sleeve which is useful for twists as well as insulating during a cable damage.However in due course of use the cord often develops rigid twists turns beneath the cotton braiding which is hard to straighten out.So not so great on the cable quality terms. The cable only comes with 180 degrees of swivel movement which is quite disappointing and I would have really wished if it was 360 degrees of cord freedom. The thermostat knob for temperature selection comes with regular 5 settings but going with a reputed brand like Philips always assures of a good quality of thermostat.After all the thermostat is the heart and soul of modern day irons and must be highly durable and reliable. Lastly our product is an ISI marked product which is quite an assurance for sure.5. SOLEPLATE MATERIAL SHAPE:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThis is probably the toughest part where each company claims to have the best and easy gliding soleplates.A variety of soleplates are available in the market today like non stick Teflon coated aluminium plates with American heritage coating Steel plates with alloys or Ceramic coated.Each has its pros and cons. Teflon coated plates are easy to get scratched and gather dirt over a period of time. American Heritage is similar to Teflon and glides over the fabric even better. Stainless steel is the most durable and easy to clean however may stick to clothes on higher settings.Adds weight to the device. Metal works better than ceramic for pressing in sharp creases on sleeves and trousers. Good for smooth gliding and even heat distribution but biggest advantage is to eliminate static charge at high temperatures which may cause clothes to stick.When ironing on synthetics and fabrics blended with spandex a ceramic iron will suit your needs best as ceramic does not stick to these fabrics but the coating may peel off on rough handling. Aluminium soleplates heat up quickly but are prone to damage and may stick to clothes. Our Product comes with a linished soleplate which is quite inadequate detail as linishing is a process of grinding or polishing a surface to make it a perfect flat. However apart from linishing stuff I can surely say that the soleplate in our device is decent gliding but not the best gliding Its heavy but doesn t stick to the clothes yet.For that matter I trusted the brand reputation and went ahead with this linished soleplate. Stay away from Teflon coated ones though as its bound to wear off fast.Regarding the shape I honestly wanted it to look like American fighter planes with sharp beak design and dark colors..LOL..However those models with my looks were weak in overall specs so had to settle down with this Still Decent Looking model.6. FEATURES LIKE ANTI DRIP ANTI CALC GRIP:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxTo tell you the truth these are more of a fancy terms rather than actual purpose for most of the users. Presence of these features isn t a problem though as in areas where the water comes hard Anti calc may stir and clear the calcium build up if any in the water tank.However If you use proper water drain it out timely Do not fully fill the tank allow it to heat before using steam follow all procedures correctly you won t actually need to use these features.Regarding Grip Many iron nowadays have some unique design which is set ergonomically to give a better grip. Our product comes with the anti calc function and is decent to grip though I think not ergonomically still nothing for a deal breaker and these are minor features to discuss upon.7. PRICE VS PERFORMANCE:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxEven though I did not have any preset price tag in my mind but still going over 2500 would have definitely felt extreme for a thing that I don t make use of that much. I bought it at a price of around 1200 bucks for all the features and performance it delivers I think it is worth it.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all I would just say that even though our product might not have the best appealing looks or the best soleplate or the best burst of steam or the best swivel of the cord still what it has is a complete package of all the individual features clubbed together in a decent right performing way which is hard to come by in an individual model. I got this one on demand from mother. For a few days she was insisting on buying one iron for daily chores. I was already researching iron for one of my friends. So this search did not last long. :DEven earlier Philips was the only name that came to my mind due to its consistency product quality. I also had Bajaj Usha Morphy in the list. But trust in Philips did not let me go for any other brand.I got this Iron well in one piece and without any scratches on the soleplate. INSIDE BOX Steam Iron inside a poly pack Instruction leaflet/Warranty card ABOUT Wattage: 1440 wattWeight: 1 kgWater Capacity: 180 mlCord length: 1.8 meterIndicator: on/off based on temperature setting Max Water level markingWarranty: 2 years PROS 1. Good quality iron with effective ironing steaming.2. Body is solid with good finish overall at this range.3. Linished Teflon coated soleplate for easy gliding on all fabrics. Gliding is somewhat limited in steam mode due to moisture.4. Sufficiently long cable with swivel joint at iron for easy movement and usage.5. Capacity of the water tank is sufficient for average steaming operation 30 min or more in one fill .6. Spray function is well designed it evenly sprays water and not just throws a fine jet of water.7. The spray function produces a fine mist that evenly moistens the fabric making it easier to iron out tough creases.8. Wattage 1440w is sufficient enough for home usage and can easily cover tough wrinkles and heavy clothes.9. Easy and fast filling of the tank owing to the huge filling hole.10. Easy and complete emptying of the water tank owing to the large hole and the sideways opening door.11. Weight on the ok side not a lightweight but not even heavyweight. Some weight is useful as it helps ironing by applying pressure on the cloth. Empty iron is lightweight only. CONS 1. Steam control knob looks loose at first but it works well in the long run.2. Water movement during iron creates jerks and affects smooth operation. But that s the way it will work you can t do anything.3. For regular lightweight iron users it will appear bulky at first. But you get used to it in a few days.4. No steam burst function in this model GC1905 but you get what you pay for. Cons are temporary and don t affect functionality in the long run. So a device. BUTTONS KNOBS Spray Button push to spraySteam Knob Off: no steam Low: less steam High: high steam Calc clean mode: calcium deposit cleaning more below Temperature Dial Rotate to set temperature cutoff for different fabric types Linen Cotton Woolen Silk etc USAGE GUIDE 1. Keep knob dial in off position.2. Fill the tank to the max level if planning to use steam function.3. Connect to mains.4. Set the temperature control knob to the required position.5. Let it warm up until the indicator goes off.6. Now operate steam knob to low or high steam.7. Enjoy ironing or steaming without interruption till water lasts.8. Use water spray function as required. USAGE TIPS 1. Use RO filtered water if possible as it s low in hardness and will ensure the longevity of iron without choking the vents or orifices.2. let the iron heat properly before use. Leakage has been observed if one uses the Iron without heating properly as water will directly pass from vents without getting converted to steam.3. Gently clean soleplate and don t use any hard material or chemicals.4. Emptying water tank every time after usage is recommended to avoid scaling problem. As calcium deposits are more in standing water.5. Untangle straighten the cord once after every use before storage. As these cords tend to develop sharp irrecoverable turns over time and those are hot zones for cable failure.6. When not using steam function keep the steam knob in off position.7. Use calc clean mode once in 2 weeks if using normal tap water with medium hardness. If water is very hard increase the frequency or if using RO water decrease frequency.8. Once in a few months clean steam control needle using vinegar. To remove the needle rotate the knob to calc clean mode and gently pull it out.9. Last but most important use a properly earthed wall socket for iron to avoid shocks. CALC CLEANING MODE This iron has a calc cleaning mode to descale it. To do so follow the steps below:1. Keep knob in the steam off position.2. Fill tank to max level.3. Rotate temperature dial to max position and wait for the indicator to go off.4. Take out socket from mains and move iron to sink.5. Turn the steam knob to calc clean position and pull it up a few cms.6. Let all water be used up.7. Steam and hot water come out along with calcium deposits. The principle behind this function is a sudden change in temperatures of inside zone which leads to contraction expansion resulting in scaling shredding and flush out. CLARIFICATION: DAMAGE TO BODY OR PLATE OTHER ISSUES concerns raised by other users Several users posted about the damaged product or soleplate on arrival and other usage issues. Let me put my insights into those. I had no issue with the quality of the product delivered. It arrived in proper condition without any damage anywhere as proper care was taken for this using air cushions. Maybe their seller was careless enough and that resulted in damage during transit. Soleplate had no marks on it. Yes here Philips can provide a protective sticker or film on the plate which will reduce the ratio of complaints for the damaged sole plate on arrival. Temperature dial works properly and markings are intact after months of usage. Slight difference in color tone maybe there across different zones as different materials are used as per requirement. Say hot zone near plate vs cold zone at back. Leakage will be there if the steam knob is in steam position and iron is not sufficiently hot to convert incoming water. So it s passed directly appears as leakage. Philips has explicitly mentioned this in product details. Remember to order it from a reputed seller. Check seller ratings reviews and amazon verified tag to avoid any issues like the faulty product duplicate product etc. DON T GET CONFUSED There s No Steam Burst Mode Here 1. Some of the photos displayed are with steam burst function symbol on the button even some users have mentioned this in their reviews but it is not present in this model. Models with the said function have two buttons for spray burst instead of one here for spray only .2. Also steam output at one place is 13g/min another place 17g/min. Its actually 17g/min. FINAL VERDICT If you are looking for good quality durable steaming iron in the 1.5k range Philips is the name you should seek for. This model of Philips has got good build quality features which are more than enough for an average home user. So at any point you can go for this model. If on a lower budget 1k range you can go for Philips GC1011 1200w or Bajaj MX 3 1250w but both are low power and Philips one misses steam spray function too. But still both will cover most of the usage pattern of a home user. Heavy users may go for Philips EasySpeed Plus GC2040 2100w or Black Decker BD BXIR2001IN 2000w or Morphy Richards Super Glide 2000w in 2k range. NOTE Unlike regular lightweight irons steam irons generally don t go easy with repairs. Unlike regular iron If the coil is damaged in the steam iron whole of the bottom plate needs to be replaced if you are out of warranty it will cost you a lot. In fact for the cost of the plate plus a few bucks you get a new iron. So check your requirement for regular vs steam iron choose wisely. I tried removing hard wrinkles of a jeans but it couldn t remove them properly. They were still visible even after using the steam. Easyto use but it leaks water Very good Its a good product Iron is good and the best delivery with few hours just this iron doesn t have a stream burst...rest is good Simple cloth iron,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/41Xp77o YL.

And regardless of which brand name is stamped on them they look like clones of each other. It was therefore with some excitement that I bought this Havells model that had at least three novel features: an auto cut off facility a temperature control knob and a protective plastic cover for that part of the heater users could come into accidental contact with. But quite a bit of my excitement drained away when the heater arrived. I couldn t use it straightaway because it has a cord that s barely a metre long and it just couldn t reach the 16A socket it needs to be plugged into. Such heavy duty sockets are normally positioned high in most bathrooms so that they are easily accessible to any storage water heaters that may be installed. Havells should have made allowances for this and added at least another foot and a half to the cord length. For a large scale manufacturer this extra length would have made little difference to the production cost. The product anyway is priced a couple of hundred Rupees more than other 1500W heaters the MRP being even higher at Rs1000 .In my case therefore the heater had to be accessorized before it could be used: I had to buy a stool that would raise the the bucket off the floor and thus compensate for the shortness of the cord. And no it can t be any stool lying around in your home: it has to be a stool of a certain height about 14 inches for me. Any taller and the bucket can t be accommodated under the tap any shorter and you begin cursing Havells again for their miserliness with the cord. The stool took two days to arrive and I inaugurated the heater a full four days after it was delivered. Thank God my old immersion heater was still usable in spite of its heavily calcified condition.There is yet another problem with this heater: though it helpfully allows you to choose between three temperature settings you don t know what value each setting corresponds to. What does high temperature mean 60 degrees Celsius Seventy I found out the hard way when I set the temperature high and the heater wouldn t switch itself off for 15 minutes which is five minutes longer than the time my old heater takes to heat up some 20 litres of water. And by then the water had turned scaldingly hot. I tried the medium setting the next day and again had the nasty experience of having to deal with extra hot water. Perhaps the right setting is low then. I m not sure. Neither the product literature that came with the heater nor the Havells website has any information that will help you choose the right setting and stop you burning yourself.So both the innovative features of this heater that made me buy it the variable heat setting and the auto cut off ultimately turned out to be quite useless. I still have to depend on my instinct and on my experience with my old featureless heater and manually turn the heater off when I think it s done its job.I have a question for other users of this product or for the manufacturer: can the temperature be set to in between values something between low and medium for instance. The way the controlling knob is marked with several lines between the presets suggests this is possible. Or maybe that s yet another useless feature of this fancy heater. More trial and error But should such a basic piece of equipment be so difficult to use UpdateAfter a week s use of this heater I d like to add a word of caution for the benefit of other buyers and users. Since the heater has its own indicator light which switches off at the set temperature you may forget to switch the socket switch off particularly if the switch is away from the socket as in some contemporary bathrooms that have all switches bunched together at the bathroom door. If you forget to switch the socket off and in the meantime have removed the heater from the bucket it will begin to heat up again once the temperature has fallen below the set value. This dry heating will damage both the heater and wall if you ve hung the heater up. But more significantly it will also be extremely hazardous if your body is wet and there s no one around to switch the socket off for you. This happened to me twice. Call me dumb if you want to but please be careful. The product is good and does its work. I didn t find any use of the thermostat feature as though it turns off automatically the low temper in itself is very hot. It take just 5 to 7 mins to get the water be bath ready. Further the product says that ilthe rod should not touch the bucket but the product handle is made in such a way that it touches but that causes no trouble. It s not shock proof so don t check temperature of water with it turned on. Product received with some scratchesDon t know how inside package product gets scratchesOther than that all is okay product is goodAnd it s shock proof for extra safety but no recommended to touch water Value for money Product is good satisfactory one minor issue the cord is little too hard. Its working as expected. no issues found till now but i have observed the red light is not coming fully. i could see only partial red light is visible. overall best product nice This product is very good and easy to use but its plug is of 16 amps which should have been of 6 amps,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/31flPimoFpL.

Best for hot water https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/71hGSlIeBIL. SY88.jpg As per the price bottle is not sturdy and very light weight. Kettle is also thin but heats fast. Like other market standard both bottle and kettle should be sturdy. Has to handle very delicately otherwise dent will be inevitable. The product is a good package. The bottle accompanied is a regular steel bottle and not a thermos. The kettle is very difficult to clean so better avoiding doing anything which stains it. The switch seemed to get jammed but with a little push it started to work again. Steel Quality not good The kettle is good for winters. You can boil the water within a few minutes. But the length of cord is short. It would be better if it is long.Overall the experience was good. You can go for it. It is truly an amazing product for your parents. That s why I m rating it 4 star.

Deepa Kindle Customer Bharat Chugh A.P.Gohil Kapil,Vaccum cleaner Ok Good product Quite loud heats quickly but very good for cleaning upholstery Compact in size Only for limited light duty usage Value for money Good bargain Handy n works well,I am writting this after 4months usuage Go for it as suction power is too good only cons is dust capacity is very limited as we need to clean frequently It s too heavy to be handle. And not good for deep cleaning. I tried to clean matresses and sofa but dusts were there. Too early to write the review but working good so far Likes: Handy easy to use comparatively light Cleans extremely well due to strong suction power. looks good. Good clean design. power cord is very long. easy to store doesn t take up much spaceDislikes: heated up quite a lot within 2 minutes not even 5 minutes after cleaning an upholstered stool and foot rug . Had to switch off and let it cool. So obviously not something that can be used at a stretch to clean all your upholstery etc. like other more expensive vacuum cleaners no flexible hose with the more expensive version with extension stick. When one has paid much more providing the small flexible hose which is meant for cleaning inaccessible areas like underneath sofas ceilings etc was something i expected. I m sure the hose itself is pretty inexpensive. They could easily have provided it at no extra cost. If one needs that hose one needs to buy the less expensive unit again just to get the hose as it s not even available for sale separately. manual is hopelessly inadequate had to look up YouTube videos. no soft brush provided for cleaning the filter. does not come in Amazon packaging even though it s fulfilled by Amazon. It s just the Agaro box think is closed by openable flaps not even sealed. So we cannot be sure if it s a returned defective product or brand new one. No quality check sticker or anything assuring that the product has been checked before packing. On a YouTube video there was a sticker at the joint of dust connector and main body on mine there is no sticker just slight sticky residue. So it s been removed by someone. Not sure if it s a returned product again as there is no seals on the box . I don t want to return this as i already had returned one box that was filthy with oil stains and had opened from the bottom flaps had come apart none of the attachments etc were sealed in their plastic cover packets. Quite loud. Reading the reviews i thought it would be less noisy but it s not. No blower function other brands in this range have . Would have been great to have this. Only 3 attachments floor / carpet brush multipurpose brush crevice nozzle other brands in this range have many more. an extra filter would have been a good gesture to include. not very light. If one wants to clean high surfaces like sides of ceiling or ceiling fans etc one needs to lift it and hold in hand while cleaning. Very difficult to do especially for ladies or at least me a middle aged lady . Again here the flexible hose if provided would have been handy. Someone could hold the vacuum cleaner while using the hose to clean high areas.All in all reasonably happy with this purchase as it is a supplementary one to my existing 35 year old Eureka Forbes vacuum cleaner which is still going strong as the upholstery cleaning attachments for that model got lost.I do feel strongly though that the price could have been reduced considering all the above pros and cons. Compact size It is a light duty light usage and a limited application area equipment. Not for effective complete usage. It s a good vaccum good suction and easy to clean up. However the suction sound is quite loud. Nevertheless it s a good machine. Does the job well. The product works well. It just heats up after using for 15mins.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/41IymCXFA7L.

Category: Home Appliances.,Icu Pavish Krrish kumar Vit Bernatik Sanjay 6266 surykant gonarkar Monu VikramJit Singh Khaira,Product as describe Good product Good product but price high. I miss my gas stove.... Induction sucks : Great value No1 Good,I recvd product within 3 dys while owing to rural area other product tks 10 dys to deliver n product recvd at gd condition n works well aftr use if smthng cms up will review again It works good. Nice heating. But hard to clean as it has ridges and small gap between the hot plate and the controls and also below the plate edges.. Other than that fine product 2500 se jyada price nahi hona chahiye tha. Use karne mein bahut achha hai Over all I m really disappointed by the product and especially cooking experience. I was used to normal gas and it was easy to regulate to propper temperature. This product has only like 8 temperature settings and it is either too hot or too cold and cannot be set in middle. For example when I set 160 C then it is burning toasts and onions... When I set one step lower it is 130 C and it is not enough for frying : .Also you need to buy more expensive induction friendly cookware. And even when I invest to expensive Tefal pan it heat mostly in the center and it is much colder on the edges... You can see on pictures that watter boiling only in middle and toast being burnt in middle and raw outside : The pan is very good and has induction area over whole bottom so I m sure the fault is in this philips stove... You can see the pan from bottom that induction area is almost over whole bottom... Also due to fact that only center is hot then frying onions is taking much longer than on normal gas stove where heat is better distributed : And even though you spent more time frying the onions the result is worse... Onion is little burned from outside and still not soft inside... I m really disappointed by frying experience compared to gas stove...There is one positive side and that is that heating is quick. My pressure cooker star whistling quite quickly. Faster than on gas stove. Also you can set time for like 10 minut and leave it which is quite convenient...Controll is easy. But I hate details. First I love one detail. There is pause button which is very cool. If something heats too quickly or you just need to quickly do something else you press pause button and there is no new heat It is much nicer compared to gas stove where you would need to turn off light up again and then find right flame again... Here you just press pause again and cook as before... But that is only thing that I love. Otherwise I hate how it is designed.... First basiclly whole top row of buttons is useless. Those buttons are preset temperatures. But anyway those temperatures are wrong or just for items you do not cook... Like there is stirr fry button and it set 180C. It totally burns onion... I set usually 180C for beginning and then soon change for 160C. But even 160C is too much burning... But lower setting is only 130C which is not frying at all. I would need like 150C I guess and it is impossible to set : ...Also I noticed another issue that stove is sometimes making automatic pauses. It heats and than probably when it thinks it is too hot then it stop completelly and in like 10 seconds starts again. So instead of consistentn temperatures it is doing on and off.But back to controll. Except from fact that preset temperatures are useless when you want to change temperature it won t let you or let you to do only one but not 2 times . Why I don t know probably ill will... You need to first press manual button which change temperature completely to 130C and only then you can freely press / and set your desired temperature. So basically I never use any preset mode and I always only press manual and / to set my temperature...Another control is setting time. I must say satting time is useful feature and I love it but how it is implemented I hate. When you press time button then by default it set 30 minutes... Ok but when you hold button it jumps so quickly that in one second it counts to 0 and roll to 3 hours.... Holding increment/decrement is so quick that it is useless. It must have implement some idiot... Anyway you can always click one by one. So to set 10 minutes you must click time button and then click 20 times minus button to set 10 minutes... It is doable but pretty annoying. Or I long press it usially jumps directly to 3 hours and then I press 11 times ... Still anoying but I save like 8 clicks... What is super idiotic is that when I want to add 5 minutes I click time and it by default set 30 minutes again : Arrrrggghhhhh.... So instead of just click time and 5 times I need to click 25 times : .... Really this must have done some idiot.... Another unpleasant thing is that if you need to change temperature you can not... Imagine something starts burning and you need to wait like 3 seconds and not pressing / and then after those 3 seconds time setting mode is automatically left and it will let you change temperatures again... When controlling stupidity is burning my food it makes me angry : So over all I would buy anything else next time... Maybe it will be worse but I would at least try...Anyway to say something positive at the end I like that product looks quite durable and material quality looks good. Packaging was also well. But power cable is only like 1.2 meters.... That might be too short... But for me just enough... Also I like mechanic buttons some stove has capacity buttons which is cool looking and totally flat but I like to feel the press and the click. Buttons are under foil so there is no risk of something leaking into them. Cleaning is very easy cos it is almost flat : Cleaning experience is much better than cleaning gas stove... Product is good but service center problem not available nearly. No1 Ordered 3 one was faulty,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41Bnylq337S.

Good Multicooker within budget Agaro esteem Multi kettle Quality Very nice product. Like it. Nice one for hostellers. A must buy product.,1. I have used it mainly for boiling water knob turned maximum to right so cannot comment much about lower temperature settings.2. It takes about 10 min for water to boil.3. Suggest Mfr to release in other colour like light blue etc as I see some other kettles . It may add to the looks and give a warm feeling in the room.4. The stainless steel looks shiny but the material is not very thick but it s ok for the price. There may be formation of scaling or white brownish spots on the base of kettle in a C shape due to the C shaped half coil at base funny design maybe a product created by modifying a higher wattage full circular coil kettle . The scales are more when tap water is used due to higher presence of salts maybe. They seem to get cleaned by usual scrubbing.5. Given wide based cylinder shape it is very easy to clean.To be aware: The kettle does not auto shut off when water boils. Similarly the kettle temperature will be kept warm at knob setting unless the knob is at the leftmost when it shuts off. Else the water will keep drying out until it dries out completely and then the kettle is supposed to auto shut off to prevent dry heating I haven t tested this though . These are mentioned in the manual. So this can be thought of as a warmer boiler. So you CANNOT leave the kettle unattended thinking that it will auto shut off like other kettles when the water has started to boil. I assume this is designed this way to allow a bit of cooking for those who want to use it in that manner.Accessories: Cannot fathom what the use is of the plastic bowl provided. Given that plastics can leach chemicals when heated I would not suggest to use it inside the kettle in any way e.g. steaming. A steel rack is given too. That could be used alongwith some steel plate with holes for steam cooking but there is none provided with the product itself.Final verdict: If you are ok with a somewhat slower heating kettle but with more versatility and easy to clean at a reasonable price this will do the job. If a similar product was available with higher wattage at a higher price I would have bought that instead. I wanted to give 1 star rating because Agaro forces its customers to give rating and review to get the warranty. It is a bad practice. You cannot force customer to give rating. As I mentioned it may result in the product having negative rating on Amazon despite being a good product.In my opinion the product itself is good. It heats water very fast. It is good for making Maggie pasta and boiling eggs. But need to be careful while making Maggie or pasta because once they get dry they start to stick to the bottom.The kettle is very easy to clean.The cord length should have been longer.One issue that I noticed that only one half of the base of kettle generates heat. Everything is good it has been very useful for me. There is only one drawback I guess the heating is not uniform across the base of the kettle since whenever I boil milk or make tea/coffee a portion of one side bunrs the milk. Even while boiling water I can see the similar symptom. Agaro Multicooker is good and gives a variety of cooking/ boiling options like Milk Tea Eggs Maggi etc.Only negative point is that Agaro team promises extended warranty of 6 months by giving asking to give a positive review on Amazon but fails to deliver on their promise and does not give any extended warranty. Delivery has safe got item safely.Delivery on time instantaneous water boiling sufficient space big volume best for hostel students.Hope for warranty and company response. I liked how fast it does the work but i hate about the dirt it gets inside after cooking something it sticks their Overall gorgeous product. The most beautiful thing is that the cord length is big.

Superb Average product. Handy but has flaws. Takes time to cool but overall good product great product and really handy Great product..nd best to carry in traveling Too costly,Useful for dark colour n delicate dress What an amazing product. Was quite sceptical before buying it after reading all these mixed reviews but glad i did.Smoothens out the creases from dresses coats woollens and any fabric which is otherwise non iron able. Of course you can t expect it to crease out the cotton shirts but It is a very handy product especially if you are travelling. Also the steam sanitises the clothes making them odour free.The water tank is small and needs to be re filled again after about 2 clothes but bigger tank would have made it heavy and difficult to operate.Overall good purchase. Loving this product while using It does the job pretty well.The cons according to me are 1. You cannot use it with clothes placed on horizontal flat surfaces. Because the water doesn t reach the outlet in the tank if the tank is half empty. The alternative is that the dress has to be hanged to a cloth hanger and then use the steamer.2. Be careful while steaming as it may burn the skin. Keep you palm at a safe distance while steaming the dress. This may be an issue when you try to steam the sleeves of the garment and also for flowing dresses.3. Not all fabrics can be completely wrinkle free.4. It sometimes leaves more steam and water at times leaving your garment with wet patches. The garment feels wet after using the steamer.5. You have to keep filling the tank twice for using it on one top. Easy to use sturdy and does the job only thing is that it takes time to cool rest of all good Its an amazing product and easy to use. Just hang the cloth somewhere and start using this. Great product..easy to carry..foldable...and results great An average product but the cost is too high as it doesn t completely satisfy your purpose.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/31LsgYDJNkL.

Good Small jar defective,Okay I have to say the following 5 things.1. Quite noisy but not much not at the level where your land lord will come down and tell you to keep the noise down.2. Lock is good and easy to clean.3. Plastic quality is good.4. Handy and easy too use.5. Do not make it grind or blend for more than a minute in a single stretch the motor will start smoking. I have a small kitchen so this is just perfect for me as it requires very less space on my countertop. Using it for the last 2 weeks and I am happy with its grinding capacity design and blending performance so far. I prefer making small batches of homemade spices and baby food cereals so it s a very good option for me. It is a good choice for powdering small quantities of spices. It comes with 2 blades onefor grinding and the other for extraction. The extraction blade is suitable for making smoothies. To start with the look is very stylish and trendy I use it for smoothies milkshakes everyday...it is very convenient for everyday use since its very quick for portion size use cleaning is also very simple..Lock mechanism is amazing and grinding technology is fascinating just fix rotate and it starts grinding ..only disadvantage is the noise it makes while initial grinding The product is quite nice and very compact. Firstly I faced issue while starting the Nutri blender as it didn t start on it s own I need to hold it tightly then it started to run. Otherwise the product is good overall. It is good for grinding and blending for small quantities.It is easy to use .Cleaning is also easy .It is best for making juices smoothies and all types of chutneys. I do my cooking my cooking work fast with the help of this product as it takes less time to chop .I recommended this product Product size is small but product quality is not good I used this product for 3 months and problems have arrived soon. Sometimes the blender doesn t work and all the time some black grease like substance keep coming out and get mixed with food. Like it and recommend it Small jar not working .....,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41gZhEcCCQL.

Amazon Customer Vivek Raj Ishan s. Tanoj,Product is good but the installation provider team is pathetic Mediocre performance with pathetic installation experience Satisfaction No invoice inside the cartoon for warranty claim Ok Happy Good product Good ... But some problems in installing,Amazon delivery was prompt and on time received next day off ordering not even 24hr 5 star for amazon and delivery product packing was very good. Guys product is good but you need to find your own ways to instalation. For installation we had to call the customer service of Crompton where in they registered the request and they provide the third party installation team number for the specific area where in we have to call for installation they picked up the call registered the installation request and updated us they will call us back in 5 minutes to confirm the installation time but there was no call back for two days and when we called back many times they don t even bother to pick up the call but they were promptly disconnecting the call. Company needs to check the credibility of service provider and take appropriate action otherwise brand popularity will go for a toss. Hope company takes appropriate action. Pathetic installation service from Crompton. Had to call them multiple times before assigning a mechanic . The mechanic who came had 0 knowledge about installation or the machine. Worried what they would provide in case of breakdown or machine malfunction. Would suggest users to think about the cons before purchase. Product is average nothing too exceptional to write about. Will suit you good enough not excellent. Is Good To use but What i Observed is that Its heats The water at 80 Only Not more than its not that Hot to mix But Its Good If Heat and Ready to bath. .. It takes Around 12 min to heat Good to Bath In winter Invoice should have been given inside the cartoon for problem in future if any with the geyser .

Must have for every kitchen,I recently recived the product and have used only once so review is basis that.Looks wise very sleek product and looks sturdy.

Borosil chopper has 2 year warranty as well so thats a plus.Will update as i use it more Warranty bill card not available inside the package Didn t get the whisking blade. Amazon has only the option to return the product. The product is good hence I only want the whisking blade sent to me. Finally i found the right box among multple amazon parcels I received and my neighbour handed over to me and it is perfectly working borosil electric chopper which is must have. I was looking for a durable and best chopper. Borosil make best products. I am using other borosil electronics for years and they are just great.This copper chop the veggies within 5 sec and outcome is just awesome. Go for it without any second thought. I liked this product. Chops even ginger in seconds.Made my cooking easier. The vegetables are chopped in even small sizes and can be added to chila or Paratha or even dosa flour for healthy diet for children.If you plan to buy one go for it.

Great product and working fine Very nice product..only wire is small in size otherwise its good easy to use but very very short wire,It is very easy to use and egg get boiled within 15min. It is portable and easy to carry and cook 7eggs in one time. even design and Quality of the product is nice. amazing product in less money. Thanks Amazon Good to use. Egg boiled properly. The only thing wrong colored product is delivered but thats ok. I will manage. Amazing product with automatic off facility. Easy to use and time efficient. Must try it Good product Just improve quality and working is very good. It works really good it s been a month now using this boiler and it works fine till date. Things to make note of: 1 When you boil keeping all 7 eggs at a time there re chances of slight breaking of 1 or 2 eggs which in my case but works fine if you try with 6 or 5 or lesser no. 2 The wire is short so you ll need to have plug point nearer to the base or use a stool. 3 The boiled eggs are slight softer whites than the usual eggs that are boiled on stove but you ll get accoustemed to it. 4 Can be used only to boil eggs and frying directly is not working. 5 Measuring cup is provided and can be used to measure water for soft medium or hard boiling of eggs https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/71 aTgWX3dL. SY88.jpg It s very convenient to boil the eggs. Good for everyday use. Only problem is the wire is very very short just 1ft it makes bit tricky to use as you need to put something below so that the plug could reach the socket atleast they should have provided 1mtr length wire.Cleaning is easy but as it has air openings at bottom you need to carefully wash it.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/31 RWRwJZOL.

Sinduja Bibek Narayan Mantry Puneet Khanna Neeraj Amazon Customer,Heavy duty mixer grinder delivers what it promises Works fast It s not working good I had bought in 2020 and the motor is making Good machine but cap locks can be much better Good Great Mixer Grinder but not good for juices Powerfull mixer grinder Powerful but Pricey,Bosch TrueMixx Pro Mixer Grinder 1000 Watt MGM8842MIN BlackReview:I usually do not write reviews but I felt I had to write this one because when I was researching which mixer to buy I found really bad reviews that do not do justice to the product. I went with the trust on Bosch brand name and am extremely satisfied with the product. I have been using it daily sometimes multiple times in a day for past month during lockdown period. I hope this will help others.Mixer includes capacity 1 Mixer body1 Plastic blender jar 1500ml fruit filter 1 Wet grinding jar 1500 ml1 Dry grinding jar 1000 ml1 Chutney grinding jar 400 ml1 extra Pounding Blade1 SpatulaBuild and overall appearance1. The mixer grinder 1000 watt motor is extremely powerful.I have used it to grind both dry wet ingredients such asgaram masala idli/dosa mix Chana dal paste Poppy seeds paste coconut chutney dry rice and urad dal powder ginger garlic paste ice etc.I regularly blend and make milk shakes lassis etc and have found it to very fast and convenient.2. Does the job fast within few seconds/minutes depending on the amount and type of ingredients you are working with.3. Body is good looking sturdy well balanced and easy to wipe clean.4. The vacuum feet are quite secure and give a true hands free experience.5. Overload protector for added safety helps if you overload the mixer by mistake.6. The jars also are easy to use and quite well builtJars Blades1. The jars are metal with removable stainless steel blades.2. Chutney jar blade is fixed.3. An extra blade is provided for stone pounding affect.4. A spatula cum blade changer is provided.5. The Jar lids are made of transparent plastic.6. Each lid has a small top cap which can be removed to add liquids/materials while grinding/blending.7. Each lid has rubber gaskets. This gives a completely leak proof experience while grinding/blending. These gaskets are very easy to remove and attach.8. All Jars have 4 fibre clasps to close the jars.9. In the blender jar a juicer attachment has been provided this is the only thing I have not used hence I cannot review the performance of this attachment.10. Blender can be used without the juicer sieve and works fine.11. In wet blender a flow breaker is providedSoundSound is high but that is to be expected in a powerful 1000 watt machine.Do s Don tI feel if we follow certain guidelines we can best out of the product1. Do not overload2. Do not use for more than a minute without giving a little rest.3. When turning the speed knobs don t turn all at once from 0 to max. You will see that it works better if you turn knobs slowly staying at each speed for a few seconds. Actually for most things low to medium speed is enough. The machine is really powerful.4. When grinding large amount of ingredients the jar can heat up not the machine so give a little rest in between.5. For wet grinding use cold water to grind that way the jar will never heat up.6. DO NOT grind hot ingredients. Many people have complained about the rubber gaskets melting that can only have happened if hot food are being blended or ground. Bring food to room temp and then grind.7. Wash the jar gasket jars immediately using a sponge and liquid detergent so that the shine of the jar remains intact.8. Always remove and wash the gasket to avoid unhygienic conditions as food can get under the gaskets.9. In the wet blender remove the flow breaker by sliding it off and wash it separately as food particles can get stuck behind it.10. To remove fine particles when dry grinding don t use a spoon to avoid scratches to the jar. You can use your hand and a brush used for this purpose only .11. This is an expensive piece of equipment In my house only I my husband use it. We do not allow children or household help/cooks to use it. This way the machine will not be misused.12. If you mixer does not work please check the overload protector button on the underside of the machine. Remove some of the ingredients and try again.13. Take care while handling jar lids and lid tops Although they appear quite well made I cannot say if they will break when dropped.Pros1. The machine is very powerful and delivers what it promises2. It is easy to use and gives truly hands free experience3. Easy to clean4. Grinds and blends everything5. Leak proof lids.6. Takes very little time to grind7. The motor does not heat up even easily8. The overload protector works perfectlyCons1. Guarantee Manual The Manual has to be downloaded from the Amazon websiteThe Amazon payment is the guarantee. There is no separate guarantee card provided. I had to call Amazon to understand the situation regarding the guarantee card.2. Delivery The mixer grinder came in a box but there was no special Styrofoam padding. This was a big minus for me.3. A couple of extra lid clasps should be provided one of my lid clasps was loose it is working fine at the moment but as a backup company should provide these.4. As the jars are pretty large for smaller amount of products it is a little difficult. I wish the smallest chutney jar was usable for both dry wet grinding rather than only wet.5. The jars do have screws heads on the inner side but this is not a big deal and can be cleaned quite easily. Review after using for few monthsPros: The lock feature is really good for hands free usage. Grinds very fast. Say half cup soaked urud dal can be ground to paste in less than 4 minutes. Juicer is good extraction is good for the juicy fruits. Good design and takes less space in kitchen.Cons: Noise is there for the power it grinds. But anyway not that high as mentioned in some reviews which I read before my purchase.Steel jars get heated up quickly. So I used to refrigerate the soaked rice or dals to balance the heat.Just need to be careful while cleaning as there are some sharp edges which could hurt a little. wet grinding jar Tips clean the jars immediately after use to make the cleaning easy with sponge. So that jars won t loose it s shine I bought this Bosch mixer on 2020 and the motor is not working I have to buy another mixer what is the use of putting such a big amount in it.it worked only for 2 years.it was only for household purpose i purchased.very much disappointed with a brand.Showed to their mechanical he said motor is burnt from inside . True to its name the Bosch Mixer Grinder is a great machine to have in your kitchen. However the locks of the cap have given away and cleaning it is a challenge. NA This is a very good product overall. The dosa/idli and other such batters come out excellent. The motor is powerful and can handle any mixing and grinding needs.The only unsatisfactory thing about this is the juicer. It works well with slightly watery fruits like citrus oranges watermelon etc. But the moment it comes to fruits and vegetables with a lower water content the juicer fails at extracting anything. The juicer is basically another blender jar with a mesh attachment to sieve out the pulp. There is no option of being able to push the fruits closer to the blender blade which makes it difficult to crush them.All in all an excellent product as long as you stick to the citrus juices. I was a happy customer of Sujata for the past 10 years and Bosch was a a good optionGood design powerfull motor worth for the price i bought 5500 in offer It has a powerful motor does grinding pretty fast. Compact size. Lid lock clip very useful. Priced high. Juicer function is not much useful.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/51bVSwhFA1L.

Batteries are included for your convenience.,Prashant Shailesh Rege Robert Amazon Customer Tauheed Ahmed Raj ANISH Kumar Raunak,Helthgenie product Just received as of now looks good. Product seems good. The batteries packed separately inside leaked. Wonderful but ... Good but it s plastic Good for now. Awesome product Value for money ONE IN A MILLION,Just received as of now looks good in this price range. Will use it for few months and update the review. Batteries has leaked inside the packing. Had to put new ones Wonderful scale means great look good accuracy very lightweight and skinny and easy to store and very easy to clean.So far so good BUT:The durable 304 stainless steel construction is just a half true promise. Only the top plate is obviously some metal but the body is also obviously plastic.Would not even mind about this little deviation between promise and reality we all know how marketing messages have to be read but the durable stainless steel top plate fell apart from the remaining plastic part of the machine after not even 4 months of use. Seems it was simply somehow glued on top with 4 glue strips and the glue doesn t work anymore due to whatever reason didn t remove it it just fell apart during vertical storage just so after only 4 months of use . Weighting still works when I press the metal plate correctly back on top but as soon as I store it the plate separates itself again from the other part. Assembling that thing again and again for every single use is a pain i.t.a. and not what I expected.That s why I give finally another brand a chance after I complete my review. This time no more durable stainless steel construction wanted ... let me try a different construction which is even some hundreds of bucks cheaper than this thing here both prices 60% reduced today . If it keeps 5 months without breaking it s a good deal compared to this one isn t it Plastic The product I received is good. Just started using it. Will update in the future about it s pros and cons. Easy to use Good product It is referred to me by my friend who is using it for months and he is very much sure about the accuracy of this and then he reffered to me very value for money,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/51o1OVswrGS.

Maharaja is a cheater company Does the job but have one concern Value for money.,Amazon delivery is super i am used One month Two lights are gone product is good and easy to use..only issue is tubes is very bright and Stand is poor quality Box is showing to 400w 800w 1200w but it is all steps showing only 400w how it is belive product.How to Buy separate lights https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/81 JtQGOHRL. SY88.jpg Please don t buy any Maharaja Whiteline product. I have bye this room heater on January 2022. And in December 2022 one rod has stopped. I have complaint to Maharaja customer care they refused to change the rod free of cost. They are saying that rod is not under warranty. Only Box is under warranty. Maharaja is a cheater company. The concern first base of the heater is made of plastic and plastic base needs to be screwed with the metallic heater body with 2 screws. Since heater body is metallic tall and has weight the connection with plastic base doesn t feel robust/durable enough as it shakes when touched.Else all looks good and rest depends on how long it lasts. The stand needs to be more sturdy as it leans back on flat surface. Otherwise this is a good product for a 15x15 ft room 1200W.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41Y4vsQHt6L.

It helps to keep the place really warm Very good product in winter for kids and much more All ecectric devices are prone to damages and faults but it should be possible to be repaired. Unfortunately this product doesn t have that option and my purchase went for a complete waste. First things firstIt s not bad heater and it provides plenty of warmth.However the unit I received had one major or rather fatal issue. Current was passing through its entire body be it the front grill or the area near the handle in the back. You can t hold it without getting an electric shock when it s running. If you have to turn the knob or simply move it from one position to another you would need to unplug it from the power source first. Otherwise it can be fatal. If you use it in the night you have to keep it out of your reach otherwise if you wake up at night to drinking water or anything else you might accidentally touch it and die. Homes with children needs to be extra protective.Now I am not sure whether this fault is only in my unit or a general problem with these type of heaters. I have requested a replacement let s see how the replacement unit works. I ll update the review accordingly. in my heater one rod is not working then i call the bajaj customer care number it is given in pamphlet then a person came from bajaj and my issue solved,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/41WyoT08raL.

Related to packaging I am little disappointed because I was not able to make out of its new or used product. I just made sure there are no scratches on the product.

AK D. nagaraju,Should you buy this read to find out .... Good one Good Best product Stopped working in just 18days and worst after sale service Perfect Price seems to be high Solid one .better and best one.,Seller: Cloudtail India Private LimitedPrice: 2200/ Price can drop as low as 1700/ Delivery: One day Prime BangalorePackage: Big carton box with air pack No damageRecommended: YesReturnable: YESRoom Heaters which one do you need Before my review I will let you know which one should you buy. An oil heater is best that you can buy but that is worth spending for places where the weather will be colder for more than 3 months and well below 10 deg. For normal winter uses I recommend buying Convection type heaters with fan and Thermostat. Please avoid conduction based ones They can consume less power cheap but they are very slow plus burns oxygen . Also note whichever you buy make sure it has a Thermostat setting Product Review: This product from USHA is a convection type room heater and I have listed the below features and information. Twin Blade fan Thermostat built in Like AC will turn on/off as per temp changes 1000W/2000W operation 2000W means faster heating Fan only mode for normal table fan type Can t adjust speed/ ON OFF Power LED when it operates Fan noise is high and a bit annoying if your room is very calm 15A Power plug and 1m cord length Retracting stand to elevate height about 2 inches 1 year warranty for the productThe room heater uses a powerful fan to spread the heat. No Swing option very directional. You must position it correctly and securely. The Thermostat option is good to have and I suggest buyers to buy with thermostat as this will help reduce your EB bills as well as give comfortable weather inside. The thermostat is not very accurate like in Air conditioners but works. The user manual gives clear information about using it.How to set up Power on select 1000w/2000w The switch is not easy to operate Set to thermostat switch to MAX Anti clockwise Let the heater run till you feel comfortable Warm inside Reduce the thermostat slowly till the point where the unit turns off Leave that setting undisturbed and let the heater ON till morning Note if you have mistakenly set it wrongly turn off and turn on. Once again follow the same step above.I use this for my sleeping room which is about 12x12 size. In Bangalore it is about 20 21 deg at night and can drop low in another few weeks and it took about 20 30 minutes to bring it 26 27 deg with 1000w in almost closed room. Please note if your place has a room temperature Not outside temp well below and it not exposed to sunlight then it will take a long time to reach comfortable temperature. In such cases only use 2000 W setting. It does not burn oxygen but reduces relative humidity which can cause dryness so keeping a bucket or a better a tray of water will help. But you must keep your window slightly open never use it on a closed room.5A or 15A I see this as a main problem as in many of our houses we only have 15A for Washing machines and AC socket which is not easily reachable. This unit can only be plugged into 15A socket. The reason is when you operate a 230v unit with 5A socket you can only draw a maximum of 1150 Watts 230v x 5A from that socket. However since this unit operates also at 2000W it requires 15A as that could only provide up to 3000W 230v x 15A like ACs etc. However you can safely use this unit from a normal 5A socket ONLY IF YOU ARE USING AT 1000W ALWAYS. Just buy a 5A to 15A converter socket and use this. Do not worry it will work just fine but never use 2000W though If you house has MCB Tripper then it s much safe .Tips: Always keep some space from all 4 sides of the heater unit First try with fan unit for 10 minutes before using for heater Using after a long storage Keep a window slightly open for fresh air Air can feel dry after sometime can cause nose irritation and dryness. Room must be ventilated adding water tray can helpDrawbacks: 1. Fan noise sometimes unbearable in a calm room2. Average Build quality and finishingFinal words: I recommend this product a cheap and effective unit for a small to medium size rooms and it does not burn oxygen but makes dry air which can easily be overcome. The prices could drop around 1700/ sometimes so please check price before buying. Thanks for reading this if you have any doubts comment below. On first Day I had faced some minor problem in this product but day after that day till now it working with no minor and major issues. I am happy on this product . Good https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/61GxDSyE yL. SY88.jpg Hi I purchased this Usha 812T heater which got delivered to me on 29th Dec 21. We use it moderately for just 3 4 hrs in day.It was working fine for 18 days. However on 19th day i.e on 16Jan22 night after around half an hour of running it suddenly started making khad khad khad... sound and all its coil were red hot. Since we were awake I just switched off the power from main switch. It could have resulted into burning or fire if I would have delayed for few more seconds.When I picked up the heater in hand it looked some part was loosened inside.Then on the next day on 17th Jan 22 I lodged a complaint with Usha customer care na di was told the technician will visit within 48hrs. However no one came in 48 hrs. So I called up the technician on the number shared to me by Usha on 19th. After that technician visited me. Upon checking he found that out of 2 fans one fan has loosened completely and fallen inside that is why it was making sound and coils were getting too much heated.I was relaxed that it s not a big problem and would be fixed quickly. But to my surprise the plastic coupler to which the fan was screwed is not able to hold the screw tightly. There was a problem with the coupler. What kind of quality it is that within few days of usage screw automatically loosenrd and coupler not able to hold it anymore Adding to my surprise the technician was not having the new coupler for replacement. He said he will check tomorrow and come back of part is available. But he didn t came back. When I called next day he said part is not available and has informed the company but can t say when it will be available.So I called Usha customer care again and they said yes techinician has reported part is not available na dwe are forwarding your request to service team to arrange the part asap.Since then I have been calling Usha Customer care as well techinician everyday and both are throwing the ball on each other.Usha customer care is worst saying everytime that they are forwarding the request to concerned department and as soon as the part is available it will be replaced. I asked them how many days it may take as I can t keep on waiting for a month they just said they can t say when it would be available.Since it is too cold nowadays and heater is not working what is the use of purchasing this Usha heater.If they will replace it after a month winter would have already passed by then.This is a worst after sale service from big brand like Usha and it was not expected from Usha. If they don t have the basic parts available with the service center what is the use of sending technician empty handed From now on I will never recommend Usha to anyone and if any Usha representative is reading this post I request to them to service my heater asap.Thanks Go ahead The cord is very short and required 16 amp plug point. It eats up available oxygen in closed room Using since one year found fit for house use.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41A8H7PSidL.

Purrnanssh UMANATH B Dr.Susheel Kumar amruta rokade Kalzang,Good but not fast enough Excellent product Very slow heating A silent heater Easy to operate and the performance is good. Recived room heater of only 9 fins than 11. It s nice Heats the the room very well,Hi I used this 13fin heater in a 12x 14 feet room with roof hight at 10ft.It tood 1 hr 30 minutes to raise temperature by 2 degree from 14.4 to 16.5. Room was closed.I retirmed it. Bought Black Decker 11 fin which is too fast and surpass this bajaj 13fin. Bajaj name in itself a guarantee of excellence. A very product. Heats up the house in no time. Like a boon to elderly people like us This is my review after 3 days of usage. Firstly I feel I got a used product as the packing was already unpacked inside the box and normally with a brand new unused oil heater on first usage you get a smell as the oil and fins heat up for first time. This did not happen for me. Anyways I just thought to see if all is good and hope it performs.The heater has very very slow heating. You need to run it at max thermostat and with full load 2500 or 2900 W and even then it will take very long to feel the warmth. I was able to touch the fins for a second even after operating it for more than an hour without cutting off. Thermostat cut off works but quite below max and then it wont heat up as it gets cut off and on.For such type of heater the room should have just one entry and that should not keep opening often. If you have doors opening every now and then it will not keep room warm.Over all for the price it has I didn t feel like its worth to operate it when it has so slow heating. This clearly is one of the best oil heater out there at a very good price. In offline i was getting 13 fin model for 12k to 13k but here at Amazon i got it at Rs. 9799. This is very silent and heats up the room in 20 to 30 min. Really worth for the money spent. Easy to use and can be moved to other rooms without any difficulty. The performance is good. The product is good but the desired product was not delivered I am happy with my decision to buy this heater. Room gets warm and comfy . The radiator works very well even in the cold Kullu weather. Has 2 heat settings and when you ve turned it on for a while you can turn the heat settings off and the fan will still blow warm air. Very effective and doesn t give you headache like the rod heaters do. Has auto cutoff as well.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41PhEVR4X4L.

Colonel PSV Ramana Tarique Hossain Durratussharaf najmuddin Athappan Amazon Customer Priyajit Samanta Gopi,It s good product for other company. Value for money Not satisfy with the speed Cleaning is problematic Ok Good Good looking fan but motor fitted with fiber body.. Quality ok. Good one with bigger not sure about dimension wise.,I like this. Value for money compared to other company overall is good product. Good product that is value for money. Not that high speed as shown in videos not satisfy with the speed over all its easy to use easy to install The product mechanism is like any other exhaust fan in the market. I realized that the size of the exhaust fan doesn t really have a noticeable impact on suction power of air.Nonetheless its drawbacks are that because of the small space between the fan blades it is ultimately impossible to clean any dust/oil buildups on the inside rods and the shutter walls. The only way to clean the aforementioned areas is from the posterior side of the exhaust fan which is difficult to reach in most housing situations.

Saravanakumar J pravanjan panda,I received a damaged product Some defects but working as of now Using for morenthan 6 months now. Very good product Cord length is too small Easy to use Noise of good quality,The product really looks good and classy unless it was not damaged The kettle looks sleek but there seem to be some design defects. The base and the bottle dont seem to fit exactly so that the entire contraction wobbles about when the water starts boiling. Then while pouring hot steam which enters the handle thru the steam sensor hole makes the handle too hot. i had to tape the handle to insulate my hand from the hot handle. The switch doesn t fit the slot on the handle perfectly and i also noticed some water drops condensing on the inside of the switch on the handle.I used a Prestige kettle earlier which had much better workmanship. But these are all made in China anyway. i have nothing against China here with the Wipro kettle there seems to have been a bad lot which possibly explains why the price is lower than that of other models offered by Wipro.This is a problem with shopping on Amazon that one gets sucked into price comparisons and going for the cheaper option which are mostly defective products without any disclaimer. In this case i consciously went for this option on the hope that it would not be a serious defect. Lets see if my hope is allayed. It s too good and using it for.more than 6 months now Nice product https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/71P0bAv1bAL.

It is quite handy and is able to make pretty good fruit shakes and smoothies. I add a couple of ice cubes and it manages to crush them but needs more than one cycle. Battery life is acceptable I charge after every 5 6 uses. The motor runs at full all the time I thought that I would be able to tell when the battery gets low but no it will simply stop at the last second with no way to tell if it is getting low. Initially I wondered if the exposed charging port would lead to any problems or not but I have been careful with it and have had no issues.I find it to be a great and useful product for one person. Get a proper non portable blender if you want to use it for blending hard dry substances or for multiple people. Easy to use Best Blender used so far Great product. Very compact and easy to carry. Can t blend hard items but works for soft fruit smoothies or milkshakes. We liked this product Build is solid. And the motor is powerful enough for its purpose. It would have been perfect if the charging port was not exposed. Good oneSatisfied I am using this product since 2weeks.It is good upto now. I am using this for only milk shake with banana only.its blending is good https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/61yaKvhqNSL.

Simple and Effective A On the heavier side but satisfied with the product Good quality heavy noise Great Product Awesome Cleaning Machine,Once you start using a bagless vacuum cleaner you will never turn back using it on a weekly basis since Nov 2021 so its a long tern review . Coming from another vacuum cleaner that had bags this one is truly a hassle free cleaner at least you are away from the hassle of maintaining/cleaning/replacing bags which is truly a mess and you would understand only if you have used cleaners with bags. Further devices with bags tend to get chocked now and then leading to less suction. INSIDE BOX 1. Vacuum cleaner unit2. Flexible pipe with integrated retraceable brush and suction adjustment knob3. Turbo brush nozzle4. Multi clean nozzle5. High suction flat inlet nozzle6. Telescopic extension pipe7. User manual8. Warranty cardThe power cord is 6mtr and device comes with a mechanish to retrace it back into the machine. It has normal 16 amp 2 pin top which can easily fit in 3 or 5 pin sockets both 5/6 amp or 15/16amp but better to connect it to 15/16 amp ones only considering its power consumption. OBSERVATIONS PROS 1. Device has high suction power and can be cleaned easily with a bagless design where dust collects in a chamber and you can empty it in the dustbin no hassles of cleaning and replacing bags.2. Components are high quality such as the telescopic extension is metallic though it s also a con for this attachment. Even plastic components are of good quality.3. Device easily moves around owing to its big and smooth wheels. You don t need to pull it by force.4. Default flexible pipe itself is long and has an integrated brush that can also be retracted. Its a highly useful attachment considering it s attached to a primary flexible pipe and is easily available for use.5. Each attachment here is multipurpose. When you open the package you feel like very few attachments are provided but when you start exploring you discover that all attachments are multipurpose. details below 6. Attachments are easy snap fit and remove ActiveLock in the company s terminology . Once you insert the attachments it click locks and can be removed by a press of a button or release lever.7. Both the turbo brush and multi nozzle have flexible neck and wheels on the bottom for easy movement and effective cleaning8. Dust collector can be opened with one press and has removable filters attached to it. These filters can be washed once in a while to prevent clogging.9. the Main unit has H13 filter system to filter fine dust dust mites etc. and is equivalent to HEPA 13 as per the company. This filter is accessible from the backside for cleaning purposes.10. Device obviously makes sound but is not in the range of causing irritation to the ears. It s in the bearable range. OBSERVATIONS CONS 1. Telescopic extension is metallic and heavy. So it s a bit of trouble to use for longer durations especially when you are trying to clean ceilings.2. Reduction of suction power is via a bypass valve built into the flexible pipe and has no way to reduce the power of the machine to reduce suction. So effectively this valve makes cleaner suck in air from in between to reduce suction at the end but then consumes the same amount of power. If there had been a control mechanism to reduce power it would also save electricity.3. Device comes with a 16amp top but its 2 pin so if you are going to use it with modular power sockets with self closing mechanism for holes it will be a trouble to plug it in everytime.4. I miss the blower system in this cleaner which is handy at times was there in my previous cleaner . They could have easily implemented it.For the cons reducing 1 star but its definitely a 4 star device. Attachments Flexbile pipe comes with an integrated brush and you can easily retract it back onto the pipe Multipurpose nozzle has a button to increase its suction power and with one press it goes nearer to the floor Turbo brush nozzle sweeps the floor or mattress with rotating bristles along the length and if you want to turn off the rotation of the brush there is a button to lock it Main unit has a system on the back and botton side to attach the multi clean and turbo brush nozzle primarily for easy sweep or for storage purposes FINAL VERDICT This bagless vacuum cleaner is a hassle free device and requires very less maintenance but it comes at a cost and if you are willing to stretch your budget it s definitely worth it. I have had no any issues so far in the past 1 year when using it regularly. This is a nice bag less vaccum cleaner with a rotating brush that does a great job of cleaning. It also comes with good set of accessories. I found it also cheaper to order it online compared to the Croma store. Two drawbacks not a deal breaker I found and I hope Philips addresses them were 1. It comes with a two pin 15 ampere plug and you need to buy an adapter to use with normal 5 ampere plugs in the house. I was afraid to use the adapter thinking that it may heat with the use but had no issues with heating of the adapter or the plugs in the wall during 15 20 minutes of cleaning each room in the house. I do not see a point in having that plug.2. During the use one just pulls it along but It has no handle to lift the machine. I believe that one can use the handle of the dust canister to lift the machine but I am afraid that repeated lifting like this will break the click on mechanism so ended up lifting the machine as a whole all the time while moving the machine without the hose.As I mentioned earlier these are not deal breaker but enough to take one star off and can have the star back if Philips addresses the issues on this great little machine. Suction power is good suitable for cleaning carpet window curtains floors and carpets.Cleaning the dust container is also very easy. Only concern i have is if some length power cord is not pulled out from machine the power wire that still reamins inside the machine is getting heat from suction motor after using the machine for nearly 1 hour and i pulled out the cord that was in the machine it was actually liitle hot to touch not sure is it safe for the live power cord to warm up like this. would have been even better if this had blower functionality also. Good product Cord length and Suction power is satisfactory Good quality heavy noise This is the first vacuum cleaner purchase for me and I can say that I am a happy customer. I bought this back in August 22 and it is serving me well. It comes with attachments that are convenient and reach high places it has three modes of cleaning tiled floors carpets and sofas and with pets in the house it has made my life that much easier. Thank you Phillips for a good product and thank you Amazon for a smooth transaction. Well built top notch quality suction power is too high.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41xQDop2T5L.

Compact.... Battery has less strength.... Easy to use to carry and quality Good for smoothies.. Nice one Worth it for a person living in PG. Good Ok for the Price. Not something perfect,Item is good but bottom lid should have provided along with the item.Once after blending juice or protein shakes we can use the top bottle directly as a sipper but without bottom lid we cant close the juice bottle and the liquid will be spoiled if not drank within 30minsI request seller to provide bottom lid to close the bottle even low cost blenders in market are providing.Else the product is ok Good and compact... Good for travelers.... To prepare the juice blends dry fruits with for me it s very helpful as I carry it while I travel Extremely handy..very good for smoothies..price on the higher side though. Good for travelling with babies or kids It s good although it did give some start issue it s just that fruit/ veggies pieces should be small. https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/61QWjkJPPzL. SY88.jpg I bought with too much expectations and found out 500ml to be too low for blending a shake with one full apple 50gm oats milks and 15gm nuts. It struggles to start and we need to turn it upside down to give the blade some momentum and then it starts blending.For someone who is going to carry it is your best bet. But for stationary heavy blending buy something else with direct power source,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/31ZbGgybh0L.

It provides hot water in 2min which is amazing. Value for money Good geyser in price range but little power hungry item,Pros:1. Most affordable option2. 2 year warrantyCons:1. No inlet and outlet pipes are given. You can purchase that offline or I found one pair on Amazon for 280/ inr2. It doesn t come with any installation service or manual.An installation from Urban Company will cost around 500 taxes which is about 550/ INRHowever after product delivery Lifelong sent me a WhatsApp message asking about installation. They charge 353 for technician and 300 for pipes.So the cost is better by Lifelong support because within 600 you get technician and the pipes.Hence choose to go with Lifelong service. I am writing this review after using the product for 5 months. It is working amazingly. The company doesn t provide installation support. You need to self install it. At the end it is value for money. Go for it. THE COMPANY SHOULD PROVIDE TECHNICIAN FOR INSTALLATION AND CONNETING PIPE SHOULD ALSO BE PROVIDED BY COMPANY.OVERALL EASY TO SET UP .LOOK OF THE GEYSER ARE PREMIUM WITH WELL INSULATED COVER.

ANTI RUST: Rust free PP body along with a weldless tank design that enhances resistance to corrosion and ensures long life,Rahul Calorie HNT Pvt Ltd Ankit Shah Santwana Bania Anupam Madhu R ANANTHA RAMULU KASIBOINA Uttam,Cute design worth buying. Not good for bathing bucket I bought it recently. Only using it for 3 days . Its okay till now heating properly.. Good product. More useful for kitchen use Good one Good product Nice product easy to install and easy to operate,I am pleased with my purchase. The installation process is easy and the product is very reliable. The 4 level safety feature ensures that the water heater is safe to use and prevents accidental scalding. The water heater heats the water quickly and the temperature can be adjusted to suit my needs. The only problem I am facing is with the indicator. Ideally the red light shows that the water is getting heated and it turns off when the water is heated enough. But in my unit it s vice versa. The green indicator is working as red and the red indicator is green. it is worth buying . it works well First of all packaging was poor.Secondly Crompton says it is good for family of 3 members bath bucket but for that waiting is too long.Go for higher rated geyser from Crompton. Installation is not hard. Instruction book is given. Only lacking point is warranty card is sign n seal. Warranty card is valueless Works just fine but I must say it is useful more for kitchen purpose and in bathroom if u don t use shower cuz after running for a couple of seconds the temp. Of the water drops heating is not that effective being instant. If anyone wants to take hot shower must go of geysers with larger storage capacity. The packaging was good and intact. No connecting pipes were inside. The power cable was very short. That made things bit difficult. I bought a 3m lengthy connecting hose for cold and hot water supply. I installed it myself and registered online on Crompton site. If you have drill machine or if you can borrow it it just takes two holes to complete the installation. Working well and makes hot water in 2mins.Do not connect using any extension box unless it is rated for 3000w. Otherwise the wires will melt. Better always try to connect directly with the socket.

It would be great if havells pay attention in packing as the product box I received first had manufacturing defects and mising parts flexible pipes . After placing a replace request with Amazon received other box which also had some minor scratches in the heater body and also found fastners were missing in the box. Good Product at this price heating is also very good the major cons of this brand is installation problem. the installation workers never come for installation at your home so you can arrange installation workers otherwise every things is good Havells should send trained technician for installation. The technician was asking for additional 600Rs charge for installing a tap of 280rs and labour charge which I personally did it. Very disgusting guy. Havells to look inti the matter. Technician do not have proper tools with him and he asks from all tools from Customer including nails pliers hammer etc. This geyser is worth to the money product as it only takes max of 10 12 minutes to make iced water very hot as well as the indicator of the product is very good as it can be be clearly seen by low vision persion due to its size and colour deptness and also makes the look of geyser very good Overall a good water heater. Deducted 1 star as the circular piece covering the light keeps coming off. Did not replace as it did not impact the function of the water heater. Value for money.. Good installation service..

Prabhat Tripathi,Degree of cleanliness of air achieved and the size of space covered Excellent in every aspect Very good Love the control from the app Purifier is good but received a second hand item Works Well Good product Just works fine,Used it to keep the air inside as clean as possible. This model does provide clean air over a reasonable sized space if the windows and doors are kept closed. Great product with a capability to reduce dust by approximately 3/4 e.g. if atmosphere pm2.5 is 300ppm it will be reduced to upto 75ppm inside room only if minimum ventilation is provided to take care the CO2 we generate.In my case I have found in my area that the ambient has CO2 at 410 ppm. If we open one window door to only by 5mm clearnce the CO2 is being maintained from 500 to 600 ppm with 2 adults inside the room based on wind velocity and direction. This adjustment 5mm clearance was achieved measuring with calibrated stand alone CO2 cum PM 1.0 2.5 10 measurement meter One more example with above ventilation arrangement the machine is in auto and ambient air pm2.5 at 198ppm room also at 198 ppm the fan speed reached medium sound audible it took some time to reach 85ppm and then it took 1min from 85 ppm to 68 ppm now fan speed changed to low speed in Auto sound is inaudible this ppm starts increasing gradually to 85ppm in 1.5 minutes now fan speed increases to medium again and the cycle repeats as long as outside pm 2.5 is 198ppm.Similarly the fan speed so it s sound can be very high if ambient pollution is very high.It needs external cleaning of it s HEPA filter every month based on pollution. The sensor may need cleaning every 3 months for accurate readings if sensor mal functions it is to be cleaned first and check before taking to any service center .It has a simple filter element with spare availability and capable to give atleast 3 times the specified life if we clean the HEPA filter element externally with vacuum cleaner regularly.It does not have ozone producing UV rays or ion generators which if not properly designed specified to customes not worry may pollute the air with ozone.It has particulate count PM 2.5 meter which is very accurate in addition it change display colour according to pollution zones to know the condition of air in the room The readings were authenticated with above calibrated stand alone meter CO2 PM1.0 PM2.5 and PM10 .We have to keep it on Auto to facilitate to change flow /speed based on pollution level it stemperature and humidity meters are also useful .Update 24.04.22 still under warranty : It developed some abnormal sound just audible when we go near to it like kitch kitch kitch.. at lowest speed. Doubt was on loosening of bottom locknut of fan and sound is ruled out from fan bearings this diagnosis also strengthened by the observation that the above sound disappeared when it is made upside down.Bottom cover opened side covers opened the bottom grill was moved down by lifting lock with columns and it was found that the button lock nut was in slightly loose condition as anticipated. The abnormal sound and mild vibration problems are resolved after tightening the nut with 13mm tubular spanner already available with me holding the fan nut is a self locking type and assembled back But opening of side covers is a tricky and risky job some locks may be broken use hand gloves to protect hands from sharp edges they may open in jerky motion . I have made some top grill locks bottom side open by cutting modification so that I can open the panels easily in future. However another Mi Air purifier 2S is working almost continuously without any problem from last 3 years.Update: 02.07.22 High abnormal sound observed. This time I want send it to service center but while lifting some material flied off from grill. So when I run it upside down many foreign material came out like some bodies of flying ants their wings and one baby lizard. Now again it is working normal. Actualy ther is no need of any smart features for an air filter. in practicality we just plug and use it. Yes air quality is improving. But it does not reduce any Allergic issues. Really liked the product i like how it shows the current AQI has a auto mode night mode that is super helpful with a baby The air purifier is 4/5 is quiet filters well and quickly. Will wait and watch for long term reliability plus the replacement filters are expensiveBut the seller shipped an item in an open box turned out to be a used product.

Low cost but does the job. Nice Good Recently purchased for extra room. Actual performance will can be measured in summer only. RPM is less. Bajaj quality is not maintained.

Coway Professional Air Purifier for Home Longest Filter Life 8500 Hrs Green True HEPA Filter Traps 99.99% Virus PM 0.1 Particles Warranty 7 Years AirMega 150 AP 1019C,Home Kitchen Heating Cooling AirQuality AirPurifiers HEPAAirPurifiers,14 400,59 900,76%,4.4,3 837,Coway,Dhatwalia Tahir Abdulla Surya Pratap Singh VIJAYAKUMAR Rana N. Arun Sengupta Amit Naveen Reddy,No visible change Effective Sensitivity Simplicity and Support Good product Nice purifier Minimal and Simple to use and great for people with allergies Works well in Noida Very easy to maintain,Lights inbuilt in this create psychological effect as they changed according to the quality of air but apart of that no visible change i have witnessed yet. Bought it after reading a lot of reviews. It is boxy in shape but a no nonsense and powerful air purifier. Easy to assemble easy to clean and good air flow. The silent mode will be more than sufficient if it is PM that you re trying to get rid of. The purifier is so effective that it draws out moisture also so do not be surprised if you feel a dry throat in the morning. I run it for a few hours in silent mode and then switch it off to avoid the dehumidifier effect. Worth the price and great customer service. I am extremely happy with this purchase.The purifier is very sensitive to impure air and makes sure to trigger purification of highest level to bring the AQI down under Good quality.The HEPA filter has longer life than most other products. Also the AQI indicator is through at LED indicator that is more accurate than the digital interface which comes with other products.The installation and functioning is extremely simple and can be done in 5 minutes.The best part is the support you receive from Coway. The day the delivery from Amazon was supposed to happen I got a call from support executive intending to help with installation and related things. A follow up call was also made to describe more.The product comes with 5 yr warranty and additional two years was provided upon registration.My flatmate also purchased the same after seeing mine functioning. Good Only drawback I found is that it does not show any reading for the pollution level. After turning it on in auto mode it turns from red to orange and then to green within 10 15 mins but showing the pollution level along would have been more convincing. I wanted a no non sense machine for the children s bedroom to control and allergies and dust especially during the winter / smog season here in Lucknow. My kids are happy with the machine since it is very easy to use and I am happy since it seems quite easy to maintain as compared to the other brands / models. Rajnish gave a nice quick demo of how to use it and maintain the device and also how to register for the 7 yr warranty. For now I am quite satisfied with the service and the product. I got this product as second purifier in home. Amazed to see the performance with simplistic looks and no jaziness. Works well. I think two things can be enhanced 1. Provide a handle to move the product around and 2. Color option.Rest all no complaints.For testing I opened the windows and then ran this purifier and in the same room I kept my Dyson to monitor AQI level. Within 30 mins it brought down the AQI level in room which was monitored by Dyson.Happy with the quality and highly recommended.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/51b5sh94f7L.

I like the new and compact design of the product easy to clean and assemble and the powerful motor with no speed option. Chopper choped and blender blend wonderfully.Things I dislikes the most is the noise its fully plastic material the only thing which is not a plastic to open eye is the blades only and the juice extractor which isn t a juice extractor actually. I always wanted a juicer and then I found this. It works like a magic so easy and so quick. The blender is also good. I using it almost every day for my juice and milkshakes. The major problem with this is that it doesn t have a regulator and also no on and off switch that s the major drawback. Over all I liked it. No other issues good product. The product is so good.But I got cracke in chopper jar after using just two or three time.So let me know can I exchange it only chopper jar The product build quality good. Using the product is very easy and after use cleaning is very easy too.... Build quality is good and jars are nice..

It s juice making skill was so so nice...It s very easy to clean.. I bought this mixer grinder and juice blender combo. It is very handy and effecient in usage. Grinds all dry and wet material nicely. The juicer gives fresh juice and removes all seeds without giving bitter taste. Crushes ice also well. Blender makes all kind of shakes and smoothies.

Pushpam choudhary,Superb Quite efficient Go for it Very nice Noisy but works good. Powerful grinding Satisfied for the time being. Solid purchase,Good mixer under 3500 Noise level is slightly high but quite efficient Product is ultimate super. Mixer quality was very nice bt juicers jar not up to the mark Very noisy. But works fine. Would have loved if it had extra bowl for that extra blade. Hectic to change blade into another bowl for using the extra blade. Suggestion: One inverted jar would be nice too. The juicer has the loose locking system all others have good locking systems. Some plastic from mesh was cut when using it that needs better alignment. Overall worth the purchase. Even with the excess noise. Also the screw tightener for changing blades broke after 3 5 changes of blades. But that is not big deal. It would have been better to have durable nut tightener. Recommend to buy this good quality attachments and powerful 750 watt motor. Not less than bosh grinder at less price. I had purchased Active 1 kw earlier from Amazon but the item being imbalanced was returned for replacement. The replacement piece received has the same defect which was returned for good. Then in view of the reviews I went for this item and so far its performance is satisfactory although some of the reviews were discouraging. If you want power as well as reasonable rates go for it.

Water tank is too small Wrinkle free and easy to handle works very well Just ok,Product is very handy but the water capacity is too low Disappointed with the product s pricing considering its wattage and usage time. You can t iron more than 2 clothes before water refill.Since the mouth area is not that much you ll need to move it so many times slowly on the whole cloth.Steam amount is fine but design is such that you can t press it hardly on to the cloth during ironing.So overall do keep in mind before buying that it s only for emergency travel purpose for de wrinkling already ironed clothes. Good product. Does what it says. Though the water tank could have been bigger. better to buy normal iron box Takes a lot of time and is not very easy to use. You will need to use the conventional iron even after using this steamer for most of the clothes. Works only for the synthetic fabrics. It s better to stick to the conventional iron. Hiii the water tank is too small and can only use for one shirt or T shirt so plz concentrate on this also Absolutely good. Easy to handle and flexible movement. It took me less than 5 mins to iron Kurti.Advice to users please follow the instructions carefully have some patience and it works great.Negative Water chamber is very small and it takes 1 full tank to iron 1 shirt/1 kurti. The Product is good unfortunately it came withou a manual. I had to figure our where the water tank was and use it . Otherwise the product works well. Very low water storage is what put me off. Otherwise its just ok. Does the job. But at times need to refill water even for single garment,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/31JaiYt3IRL.

Kiran ahuja,Oratech Best Coffee Frother Great My review about Oratech Coffee Frother for milk Good product Easy to use Good product best product Easy to use,Overall I love this Oratech Coffee frother and have used it soooo many times since purchasing it. I mostly use it to make whipped coffee but I ve also used it for mixing protein powder in milk and frothing milk / creamer for coffee.It is incredible effective for exclusively liquid substances like milk and creamer I realized this after over frothing my creamer one morning to the point of pure foam lol. After that I kept it in mind and I know to only do it for a short amount of time. Super easy to use versatile in what it can be used for as far as liquids go and tbh it just looks really cute on the coffee making section of my counter. The stand is a hugeeee plus I definitely wouldn t purchase an alternative option without one.It gets the job done for whipped coffee.I also use this product to blend my matcha powder and my turmeric cinnamon ginger coconut milk powder lattes. This frother takes out all the lumps and bumps. Because the resulting blend is smooth it does not waste the ingredients like stirring with a spoon. So so great It has made my favorites even more practical and delicious. I have not found anything about this product that I do not like. I would recommend this product to others and have already done so. Get it You will be pleased. It is the best Coffee Beater. I really liked this coffee frother. With its help I am making Cappuccino Latte at home easily. Easy to clean also. This oratech coffee frother makes coffee game easier and fun.After using it for a week.

Some other brands have two separate on/off switch for two heating elements to obtain different levels of heating. That operation is a little difficult to explain to an elderly person over phone Improvement required: Temperature setting mechanism digital display is badly missed Currently there is no mechanism to know the temperature which is being set by rotating the temperature setting knob. You simply have to guess initially and then wait and do trial and error as the temperature starts increasing slowly. It s a slow process and you can t get the right temperature in one go Digital display of temperature setting may be added.This is a general problem I didn t find digital display in any brand. This can easily become a differentiating feature.This will be particularly very useful for elderly people.In today s time when electronics is everywhere missing out on implementing digital control of temperature appears to be sheer lack of initiative.Quick suggestion:slightly bigger size is better with oil based heaters. Works good for me in Himachal. Consumes electricity but u getSilenceNo dry eyesComfortable environmentBuy it if u value ur comfort n silence.otherwise take any other blower which will dry ur eyes n throat and create a sound I liked the fan mode and the amount of heat it generates Wrong advertisement.

Aquasure from Aquaguard is a good product. I liked this product. Product is good but the service is worst till i experienced . Poor service MVP Good Ok Nice product,This product is good its only customer support and service that is pathetic. If not for that this product would have had real good rating. I received a slightly defective piece where indicators where not working. I initially raised an issue about it but there was no immediate support for that. As filter was working fine and we didn t require indicators we didn t bother to follow up. After several days the service guy came and fixed it. First time when the service guy came there was no one. So he came again and got it fixed. For immediate support its better to reach out to local authorised dealer or service as going through the official support delays the process. So considering all these I feel product is decent. Free services are limited. If we change the filter during the free services we will be charged. Filter is not free of charge during the free services. Product is good but the service is worst till i experienced .if your staying in rural areas and your planing to buy this than i will say don t prefer because I have called minimum 20 times to the Custer care they always saying that they will send the service person but even no one is calling you to response .If your product is in service period the service person even don t lift your call and say the answer .Once the lady has called me and asked some details after she say it is not come under there area and she will forward it after i think five days has been completed and i called her back she replied rudely and saying i told you this is not come under there area and i asked her atleast give me my area service person number .She gave me atlast and i called the service person and he replied he didn t recieve any complaint id so raise a complaint on service request then he will come .I am frustrated and take my product and went to Guntur to repair it . Previously i done a service with the company servicemen he put a cap on the nozzle of the water pump so it stopped working and it all damaged. They told me you have to replace the pump it cost around 3000 . I have changed it and decided not to call the service person and write a review on Amazon so the people will know about the service centre. Installation guy didn t install propery due to which water was not being purified for last one month.

No action. I raised another ticket still in open status with no effort. I may approach the national consumer helpline for action. Easy to clean but not everyone can use. Kind of heavy. The price is reasonable...water capacity is sufficient and boiling is fast used first time Inalsa electric kettle will update review after one month of usage.. best product High quality product which is so convenient to use. The design is so nice and presentable that it can be used to serve directly to guests at home or office.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41FTyQVamFL.

Indu bala Partho T. SAIPRASAD RVA abhijeet kumar Yogesh Sansanwal Rajeshwari Dhanabalan,Good Performing Air Purifier at a Decent Price Value for money Nothing earth shaking about this product It is good Great product. The product is working nicely and worth buying product. Writing after 1.5 years pros cons solution and trics do read my reviews and vote Works but no use,Here is a try at a review of this product after using it for an year now.Use Case : I am a NCR resident and the air pollution is as we know one of the worst possible if not the worst. I have it installed in the bedroom about 300 sq ft so well within the advertised max room space. While using the purifier the room is kept closed to minimize pollution addition.Build Quality : The purifier is sturdy in its built and aesthetically pleasing. It has a large front grill that acts as the air inlet and an arched back that has a larger grill for filtered air outlet. The arc helps the air to be released vertically upwards and hence does not add to direct cooling for anyone sitting in front. This helps the filters use in winter which is the main season where it is required. The top of the filter has a dark panel with touch sensitive buttons and a decent sized circular LED screen. The 4 buttons are Power Night Mode Fan Speed and Child Lock.Setup : The air purifier is shipped with its parts packed separately. Thus on unboxing the same has to be setup for use. The setup is pretty straightforward. The main filter units front can be released and the individual filters aligned in order on the central space. The installation order of the filter is as followsFirst HEPA Filter. The same has indication on top to correct installation. You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left Corner Second Active Carbon Filter. The same has indication on top to correct installation. You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left Corner Third Pre Filter. This one actually clips in place and is used to filter out the larger dust / impurities so that it does not clog the other main filters.Thus the filtering order is Pre Filter Carbon Filter HEPA filterWorking : The air purifier can be set to different modes. One of them being the automatic mode that automates the purifier working thanks to the inbuilt air quality sensor. The pollution level sensed regulates the fan speed accordingly. 4 levels are programmed and are indicated on the small circular LED screen by means of circular rings of different colors Blue Min Violet Pink Red Max . Red level would put the fan in maximum speed and blue would turn off the filter automatically.If you are not a fan of the automatic mode you can use the fan speed button to move through the option of different fan speed/modes. They areFan Speed 1 Indicated by 1 on the screenFan Speed 2 Indicated by 2 on the screenFan Speed 3 Indicated by 3 on the ScreenAutomatic Mode Indicated by A on the ScreenAllergen Mode This can be only added on top of Automatic Mode. It essentially bumps up the speed a bit on all the different color levels. This is to suit the sensitive people as this improves the air filtration rate.Turbo Mode Indicated by T on the Screen. This puts the fan in the maximum speed possibleThats pretty much the major functioning of the air purifier. Additionally the filter has an automatic/forced night mode. The purifier automatically detects the lighting in the room and once it senses low to no light it automatically goes into night mode. The same can be forced by pressing the night mode button the purifier. What this does is that if the filter is in automatic mode the fan speed is reduced on all the levels so as to minimize the noise.Summary : So as to summarize my review and add my view here the filter works pretty well for the use case i have. On regular winter pollution days its able to keep the air quality in control even when working in automatic mode its able to go down from Red levels to Blue. Switching on an off intermittently as per the air quality levels. On drastic pollution days it has a tough time managing the air quality in automatic mode and i have to force it in turbo mode to get the air quality in control. If not too much of an air change is happening in the room throughout the filter is able to get the air quality to a much acceptable levels.The air quality indicator is a great value add on to the product. Much that is missing in similar priced competitors.I am little disappointed in the night mode working as it compensates air quality over noise. I believe the purifiers task is to ensure that the air quality in room is as good as possible. By reducing the fan speed to reduce noise works ok on normal pollution days but is totally useless in any thing even a little worse when i dont want to use turbo mode just yet Durability of the filters has been decent. I have used it all through the winters last year and intermittently the summer this year but am yet to get an indication to change the HEPA or the Carbon Filter. On yes that reminds me the Air purifier would automatically sense and indicate when a filter needs to be replaced by displaying an error code on the screen. It even does that for the pre filter which does not have to be replaced but just cleaned/washed. That i have received 3 4 times this past year.Overall i still strongly recommend this product Good performance with a decent price which has been slashed a good amount from when it launched. Good product The product does not stand out notably but it probably does the work it is supposed to. It is too late now to return this product and try another make. Over all good product.bEasy to install Well designed product. Yet to experience filter replacement and consequently the recurring cost. The product is working nicely and worth buying product. Writing after almost 1.5 years all pros n cons Everything is good only problem is i live in delhi and hepa filter will cost you around 2000 and it took only 6 8 months it become totally black few advice1. Dont run it near kitchen it will catch all carbon n pores will b blocked.2. If you live in delhi check it after every month clean with vaccume cleaners.3. Seal your doors most dirt mosquito come from there open windows only that too seal them and put anti dust and mosquito net on them.4. Run it all day as when u turn it iff after 1 hour your room will be as dirty as ut was.5. You can clean pre filter only don t clean carbon and hepa filter.6. Being and indian if your hepa filter become black get some jot water put some detergent and dip it inside all dust and carbon will come out and use it again haha its paper but its so hard you can wash it 4 5 times keep it under sun light for 4 5 hours.7. Sometimes u get error of FO clean all three filter with vaccume or brush careful while cleaning with brush that dust is dangerous can cause problems so wear mask after cleaning hold ur finger on child lock to reset and it will start working8. Bhai delhi m pollution bhot h so family k lie monthly 300rs padta h filter mother wife bachy pura din gher p rhty h so its a must buy to protect them.9. Update fan speed got slow down10. Power consumption on 1st 23 watt 2nd 33 watt 3rd 40 watt max 50 watt best is keep it on automatic mode when room will be clean power consumption will reduced to 23watt and whole night it work in power efficient mode11.

Naveen Sharma Dr. Kakati DC TIWARI,Very beautiful heater but costly and less useful Decent with some flaws Good product.... Easy to handle... I won t recommend it Value for Money Product Good Product Low quality heater Everything as per the description.,It is very beautiful looking and appears imported good for placing at one spot on office table etc. and not to be moved. It is very light so easily tumbles down. wire cord is very short. Heating is good. It is not strong and sturdy but made of plastic outerbody which will break if it falls down. More than a week im using this product.Pros:compact easy to use portable good built quality.Cons:Light weight No manual control over saftey switch takes time to heat a small room small cable length.Conclusion:If you are looking for a gud luking compact heater you can buy it.If you are expecting high skip it. I like the product design quality..I m using in my room.. It takes 15 to20 min to reduce the room temperature... I will recommend this product.. The only positive about this device is its price. Otherwise all it has is negative.The heater is very light weight but that s a negative coz it s too light to trust it to work safely. A device working at such high temperature require some weight to have stability so that weay feel confident that it won t topple. The manufacture has given a safe switch at the bottom of the device but the device remains at high temp for sometime even after being off.The material body material feels very cheap and doesn t give confidence that it would last long though the PTC heating element may last long.There is nothing to prevent entry of dust and fiber into the heater that may lead to a fire in the long run if fibres accumuulate inside.Also without any dust filter the heating plates will get blocked very very soon.The switch on the backside to switch off and on also appears to be of the cheapest quality.There is not temperature control in this heater....so once you start it it will run continuously so can t be used as overnight heater in your bedroom.So I would suggest it would be better to go for slightly costly heaters which have temp control and better quality. As abious amazon delivery service is awesome received this product in 2 days.Build Built qiality is amazing dint expect this Metal frame and smooth plastic finish light weight to carry and portable.The best part I liked about it it never took time to heat just switch it on and it started blowing heat and it easily heats the room withing minutes. But bare oin mind it takes 220V power.All I can say is its the best product in this price. You will not regret buying it. The Heater is effective easy to use and very compact. Work is good I like it very much. Av very low quality heater without any temperature control. It burned my switchboard. It keeps drawing current without any control. Great product for the price considering it has ceramic element.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41C6ocE26pL.

Produces Very Good Quality Juice Premium juicer Good however... Most effective and convinient juicer i Ever had,First of all i wanted to buy one juicer to have juice instantly.. so i reviewed many juice blender and finally i bought this Philips HR1832.. i made carrot..apple... Orange.. promoganate..etc... All i did and had fantastic juice... Fruit pulp and waste all collected in one tray and it is easy to wash.. thanks for this instant juice blender. Good deal I find this Juicer amazing end to end it takes me around 10 15mins to extract the juice clean pack it back. That easy it is to Use The product is very good and user friendly. Exactly as demonstrated in video I used to have juicer many moons ago but it was a cheap model and never really produced the juice I wanted and I couldn t afford the mega posh ones which juiced fruit and veg to within and inch of its life so I was excited to be able to start using this new one. First off this is a nice compact design. It really doesn t take up much room and it has small suckers on the base to keep it in place on the kitchen surface.The juicer is simple to take apart and put together instructions are not really needed though there are some basic pictures provided on the box.The juicer spout where you put your fruit and veg in is quite small. I need to cut up my apples into quarters to fit them in and although this is not a huge flaw it is a shame as you wouldn t need it to be much bigger to get them in. So far my juicing attempts have all been successful apples raspberries grapes cucumbers carrots have all yielded a fair amount of great tasting juice. I also unwittingly popped a chopped up mango in there without realizing it is one of the starchy fruits that is apparently doesn t work with it seemed to work fine for me. I can see how a banana or avocado might not work but the mango did produce juice so you may want to experiment. The pulp left at the end is still fairly damp and I found I could easily squeeze liquid out but it s in no way dripping and I would say a decent job had been done. I know that there is a lot of goodness left in the pulp so if you want to use this then just make sure you clean your fruit before juicing and remove anything you wouldn t want in the pulp. That way once you have finished juicing you can just scoop out the pulpy goodness and do whatever you want with it.Juicers produce different quality juices. There are really 2 key areas to judge a juicer on it s juice quality. 1 Some juicers produce a higher amount of juice per food item. You can tell by the drier pulp that is extracted. 2 Some juicers produce frothier juice and warmer temperature juice 2 signs of lower quality because the air and heat are evidence of the oxidization of nutrients. A faster spinning juicer centrifugal will often produce more heat and froth which is why the masticating style juicer slower chewing action creates better quality juice.In terms of these 2 key areas this Philips does an alright job producing dry pulp and an excellent job with low froth and low temperature juice. The slow masticating action is excellent and on par with other juicers. To get more descriptive I like to run the pulp of the Philips through the juicer 1 time to get extra juice out of it. Running it a 2nd time and I get hardly any juice. One extra run of the pulp is sufficient.The specs for this juicer claim you can clean it in under 1 minute. I think this is a little optimistic but that said its not too far off. All the plastic parts rinse clean easily and quickly with warm water and the only part which takes a little more effort is the metal sieve and grater. This has teeny tiny holes in it to help separate juice and pulp and so it does get clogged up with stuff. That said I have found that using a soapy scourer sponge and gently rubbing with the green side does the trick pretty swiftly. It certainly does not take much elbow grease and I found it very easy to clean off unlike my previous juicer where you needed to scrub for half an hour and you were still finding bits the next time you used it.I think this is a pretty decent juicer for the everyday user. Yes it could produce a little more liquid from the things it juices but it is certainly not bad and the stuff it produces is on the whole clear from bits. The anti drip spout is not quite anti drip and you do need to watch out for juice on the fruit plunger when you put pieces in as I have whipped it out too quickly and splashed drops of fresh juice all over the place. For the current price I would say it is well worth it. High quality premium juicer with low noise and excellent ability to squeeze max 80 to 90% juice out of fruits and veggies. The look and feel is outstanding and way above what other options are available I have been using this for a month now.It is easy to use and clean and assemble.But at times I have seen that the pulp is also coming in the juice and sometimes it makes a different sound while it is grinding.I feel the carrot and beetroot pieces should be cut a bit smaller and not like a slice cause if i cut like a slice/flat one carrot slice got stuck within the blades and the machine made a different sound and it was not giving more juice but i could see the pulp.Try to cut the carrot pieces of atleast 1 2 inch size like a round one and not like a slicebut overall good experience as i make carrot and beatroot juice and it takes 15 20 minutes to cut grind and clean.very easy to use and very easy to assemble.Thanks Perfect home juicer easy to clean assemble and comparable i loves it,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/31 jt474B1L.

Succetion time could be on the higher side,The vacuum claims to have a powerful motor but it struggles to pick up even basic dirt and debris. I have tried using it on both carpet and hard surfaces with little success.Additionally the dust collection feature is practically non existent. Despite multiple uses the dustbin remains almost completely full after each use. The lighting feature is also fairly useless as it is not bright enough to be of much use in illuminating the areas being cleaned.Overall I would not recommend the Swiss Military VC03 Wireless Car Vacuum Cleaner. It is a poor performer and does not live up to its claims. There are much better options available on the market for car vacuum cleaners. good Good one. Go for it Cleaning suction power as claimed. Suction power is not very impressiveDoes the jobStruggle for duct that sticks to the floor .Visible and easily removed duct is sucked Works better than the previous ones I bought.

Biswajit Choudhury Nishi b. Dr Kushal Mital P Yadav Kindle Customer Umashankar,Takes space and not convenient if in a hurry Not useful for Cotton Linen and thick materiel fabrics Received broken Only for lighter fabric There is a learning curve it may take 2 people to do it It looks like an imitation product pieces don t match properly and some look very weak Excellent product and received in good condition Not great,Takes space and not convenient if in a hurry. The handheld model would be better suited and more useful for frequent use. I used this product once after reading the manual. The first impression after using it on 3 cotton shirts without starch and one pant is pathetic. None of the shirts got wrinkle free on full steam hence you could guess what it would be in trousers.Later I found it is satisfactory on silk nylon shirts T shirts etc but none will get an iron effect. Wrinkle will be there in small amount and a slight wet feel when the steam cool down but it will go if fast.It is mainly useful for ladies who wear embroidered nylon silk materials stone work fabrics etc etc men who use T shirts and nylon rich trousers. Otherwise don t even think of buying it. In my case I use cotton whites and white trousers mainly at office as I am a lawyer. Hence for me it is totally useless. No females at home and hence it is another product that grab my home space.Regarding comfort while using it I would say I am totally disappointed as the board behind it is not much of use while using g shirt because of its size which is not that long. The last two button downwards will always hard to press it to board and we have to take the hanger hold high on one hand and thus another difficult part as the nylon material needs another hands to hold it firm. Secondly the long full sleeves are totally difficult to do it though steam is applied the wrinkles won t go easily add we are not pressing it to board and it will always go here and there. The top stand is a hanger shaped but the clips attached as useless as the board comes in between. For trousers the product itself won t work good. So if we use the hanger it comes with you need to put the switch off place the handle in slot take the shirt out and then only we can use the back side to steam after waiting again to steam up switch on etc otherwise steam will go on coming out of it.Any way the product is more useful that those similar without a pressing board.The next negative thing is manual says for better lasting of product and to avoid decalcification the water After use should be drained and cleaned. Hence it means you can t use it daily morning in rush while going to office. That needs little time. At the same time you can t press all dress in a stretch and can t fold it like we do with iron box. It won t work that away. So if you have long large cupboard with hangers as in mansions you can try that.In effect buy it if you find exceptions and usages apart from what I mentioned above.P.S : I am seriously thinking of OLX Received a broked packedge. With broken item. I thought it would make my task of ironing easy but it s useless on cottons and silks . It s great to use it on chiffon and polyester. Do not buy thinking you won t need standard ironing anymore.. It is fantastic for marriages where there are many dresses net based where you can t use iron. Quick. Good for suits It looks like an imitation product pieces don t match properly and some look very weak valu Ed for money It s not effective and pressing clothes effectively seems to have an issue,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/318JzFxYqtL.

Just OK Good Good for crepe fabric dresses delicate clothing items Here iam sharing my usage experience this garment steamer very handy to use I used it for 25 day s Nice product Awsome Highly Recommended,Quality product but not very useful as far as ironing is concerned. Delivery was on time as mentioned by amazon so keep it up.The Product is kind of gift so not having much info or data in hand but whatever is shared I put it on here.The product is used twice so limited information at presentThe product is just OK.It is NOT a replacement to Iron and cannot be considered so. Yes the steam is somewhat better than Philips as the user has used Philips also but as compared it should have been price competitive.Well yes it is able to remove crease from Jeans and even T Shirt.We prefer stiff shirts for office wear so no good for Formals or Casual Shirts neither that good for pants.The water filler should have been round shape being a conical shape it does not give idea as to what level the water has been filled.Based on the water container it can steam 2 to 3 clothes at a time. Also after 2 to 3 clothes the hand get pain. So you cannot steam more garments.Also you need some kind of support at the back just hanging on the Hanger is not enough. The Manufacturer should have given a though on this and could have added an accessory either free of cost or at additional charge.Well so If I get more information I will update and change based on the same. Good not best I like the product but the only drawback i found is:A according to the water capacity tank in just about 5 min of usage you have to refill. So that way for each cloth you have to refill the tank.B it s quite heavy. So i don t recommend this for long use. If you want to steam 1 2 clothes than its fine. Also the cloth must not be hung up above your height other wise it will be painful for you to hold this heavy steamer above causing more pain .My tip is that place the steamer on a table after pressing on the steam button once the steam gets coming out you can hold your clothes swiftly move in front of the steam 2 inches away that way you will save yourself from the pain of holding it. Also pls use a plastic hanger never steam over a metal surface : https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/81Cp L1 vIL. SY88.jpg It is a nice product but only reason I gave 4 star is that it becomes too heavy when it is held with water filled in the bottle. It s only 2 days we used this product. However it s awsome and really a great worker when it comes to ironing. It s effortless and very quick. If you want to purchase a steamer go for it. It weights around 850gm without 250ml water so the only concern is weight and how long u can hold it in your hand during steaming process. Otherwise performance wise this is by far the best machine available. Quality and finishing of the product are also very good. Certainly recommended.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41CsMm ZCgL.

Great product this RO purifier Awesome product,Product and Service Review Buying price 8999 during prime day sale with 10% discount from HDFC DEBIT CARD.PRODUCT REVIEW RATING 4/5This is a new model launched during prime day from Eureka Forbes Aquaguard line of products named Aquasure delight.The product is pleasant to look and comes with a capacity of 7.5l on paper but holds only 7 liters of water equipped with reverse osmosis ultraviolet radiation lamp and manual adjustment for total dissolved solids can be manually adjusted only by service engineer the 7 liter tank fills at about 30 mins but the water wastage is very high for every 1litre water purified there is a drainage of 1 1.5 litre from the drain pipe please collect the water and reuse it for washing utensils or bathing shaving or watering plants. The drained water is same as tank water just with higher TDS . The water taste varies according to the level of TDS you choose very low TDS will give a good taste to water but at a loss of the mineral content of water which I will not recommend. The default TDS after purification is set somewhere between 80 100 drinking water should have TDS below 300 MANUFACTURER REVIEWRATING 2/51 The manufacturer of this product is Eureka Forbes I am giving a rate of 2/5 because the product that is now installed at my home is a replaced product because the first product that I received was a defective one. The drain pipe would not stop draining water even when the tank was full I asked the technician to check it and he said the valve is defective so I received a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT OUT OF THE BOX I ordered for a replacement on Amazon which they processed and I got another one in which the led lights were displaced I don t know it happened during transport or it is some manufacturing defect I would have been disappointed for the second time but I observed it and reported to the technician who replaced the led lights to their original position so that the led indicators were now visible outside. The replaced product s valve is functional and now operating without any hassle SERVICE REVIEW0/5Don t expect to have a very comfortable installation experience its going to be a heartache. The reasons are1. The people Eureka Forbes has employed as technicians are thieves I am saying this because Aquasure Delight comes with INTEGRATED DIVERTER VALVE this is a stainless steel structure that is fitted to water outlet coming from the wall so that it can act as converter to be joined to the Aquaguard inlet as I hadn t opened the package when it arrived because some or many of the companies void the warranty of you open the box containing the product mostly electrical items that need installation like TV s Washing machines Taking the precaution I didn t open the box so I was unaware that DIVERTER is included in the package The technician after fitting the diverter charged Rs 200 saying that he fitted that from his side and diverter is not included in the package. i came to know this when I opened the package of the replaced product and found THE DIVERTER INCLUDED ALONG and confronted him but he defended saying some purifiers have diverter in them and some don t. I still have to confirm this with Eureka Forbes 2 The pre filter doesn t come included in the package so the technicians sell it to you at higher prices My technician sold it to me at Rs 950 which is available at Amazon at Rs 750 but then if had ordered it from Amazon I have to install it by myself. I don t have a drill etc so I had to pay him Rs 950 so loss of Rs 400 on the technician. My opinion on this is that Eureka Forbes SHOULD SELL WATER PURIFIERA WITH PRE FILTER even though it raises the cost of the product by Rs 700 to Rs 800PLATFORM REVIEW 2/5The platform in which I bought is of course Amazon I am giving it a rating of 2/5 because I received a defective product the first time and Amazon refused to replace it because installation request was not raised by Amazon Amazon never raises an installation request unlike Flipkart which raises an installation request from its side which actually makes your life easy as in case if you receive a defective product which you notice after installation Flipkart directly consults with the technician and may even resend him to verify the authenticity of the problem For installation you have to call the Eureka Forbes toll free number and raise an installation request so Amazon representative was demanding an INSTALLATION REPORT a video or photo proof of the problem now how could I make that thief of a technician to write an installation report and about taking a photo or video I got the water purifier uninstalled as soon as I found it defective to put it up for replacement but I didn t know replacement request has these many hassles as it was my first time replacing an electronic product SUMMARY1 PRODUCT IS GOOD FOR THE MENTIONED PRICE 2 AQUASURE COMES WITH INTEGRATED DIVERTER VALVE A STAINLESS STEEL DEVICE THAT IS ATTACHED TO YOUR WATER OUTLET AND THE AQUAGUARD DON T LET YOUR TECHNICIAN CHARGE YOU FOR IT.3 THE TECHNICIAN WILL OVERCHARGE YOU FOR PRE FILTER BE READY FOR THAT.4 TECHNICIANS ARE CUNNING AND MOSTLY THIEVES SO BE SHARP AROUND THEM.5 MAKE SURE PRODUCT IS NOT DEFECTIVE IF IT IS AMAZON IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A HARD TIME REPLACING IT.6 AMAZON WILL NOT RAISE AN INSTALLATION REQUEST YOU HAVE TO RAISE IT BY YOURSELF BY CALLING EUREKA FORBES CUSTOMER CARE OVERALL VERDICT 2.5/5 if your family in 4 members you have choice eureka Forbes delight RO UV TDS this product is very effective and efficient. Agua guard provides installation with in 24 hours of delivery. before the installation had TDS level is 125 and after the installation had TDS level is 62. Nice product by Aquaguard water taste is also sweet. This is very good water purifier but I see service guy for installation seems in hurry. He just installed and went off. He did not show how much is TDS how to adjust it. Don t buy this product on Amazon. Buy it from local stores if possible. I purchased this product on a heavy Festival discount. There was problem initially after installation due to defective water holding knob. I reported this issue and immediately replacement was arranged. Although I had to wait for about two weeks. The Serviceman came and installed another piece. Since then it is working excellently. In all the best part was that the services were good and responsive. Amazon part of the business was smooth.Delivery done within timelines. Payments exchange cashback all done hassle free.Eureka Forbes another story.For installation I had to call them daily for 7 days.Finally on escalation and on hold with Eureka Forbes customer service for close to 90 minutes installation was done.Eureka Forbes now calls me every other day to force this review.My main reason for writing this review. I got the Purifier installed and before that I was having Bislery water reason why I have so many bottles which thankful came handy . The Deliver and Installation was smooth. After installation the agent mentioned to let the filter fill up completely and then throw away all the 1st batch of filtered water since it s the 1st time filteration process so it will basically clense it overall.So I decided to let it full up and once it was full I turned off the switch so no more whater comes in. I used the empty 2L Bislery bottles to fill up the 1st batch of filtered water which as shown in the image which is around 6L as Mentioned by the Company.After I emptied the Filter to its last drop I turned on the filter with another set of Empty bottles at the waste pipe side. It took quite a while to fill up the tank fully but as it did it filled up almost 13.2 L worth of bottles as seen in the image. This is roughly 220% or more than twice the amount of filtered water.Now the company claims 60% water saved in comparison to other RO UV filters and I have no knowledge of how much water wastage they do. But I think it s a bit much regardless.Fir every 6L of purified water it wastes 13L.My tal water TDS is 470Filtered water TDS is 86And the waste water TDS is 640Maybe it s because of the TDS levels due to which it wastes as much water ky does and it s possible that the amount might vary for different TDS levels at source.But I recommend to have the waste water collected and used for something else if possible rather than just letting it drain down. 13L almost everyday wasted is 390L per month and this is considering you only filter 6L of water per day.I ll redo this once more to see if there s any difference in values. This is juts to keep the potential buyers informed. I like speed to fill water n less wastage. I like Tds adjuster and easy to install . I don t like internal plastic body though I believe it s steel.. need confirmation. Overall good product we are satisfied having it installed from 3 4 weeks Deserve a 5 star on product. However ran into a problem when it comes to installation. The technicians of the servicing centre at my local area gave me a huge problem by delaying the installation. At last one technician came forward.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/31Anei7Di0L.

Now only grams are shown.litres option is not operated.,This is aesthetically the most appealing Digital Kitchen scale out of the available choices. Though it is also by far the most expensive it is value for money considering the followig pros:1. Functionality: It has only two touch buttons which integrate all the functions like Units of weight volume multiple tare weigh with overload indication and off/on It can give volume idications for water and milk two of the most frequently used liquids while other liquids can be also measured if a glass of water is calibrated for a certain volume say 100 ml ad same is marked on the glass The plastic food grade bowl fits snugly on the scale and also doubles up as a cover when the scale is not in use2. Duraility: Because of its squat oblong shape and sure footing the scale wont topple. Also since bowl fits snugly on the scale upside down when the scale is not being used it prevents dust from entering the display and buttons material is tough plastic with a recessed top which seats the bowl firmly and there is no exposed space for ingress of any spilt liquid With all this theres a one year warranty extendable to two years which speaks about the confidence of the manufacturers in their own design3. Battery Life: The device has an auto power off and a digital display which consumes very less power. Hence battery is likely to last longer.I only encountered two cons:1. Scale is very sensitive and takes some time to settle2. The display backlight goes away after some time and the lcd reading is difficult to read in bright ambient light.Overall this device serves my purpose of practical diet management very efficiently and effectively and am sure it will grow on me. Recommended if you want to get much more utility and eficiency at a slightly higher price. Litt to adjust all time Ok. Price wise it didn t last long,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41csvHnDvES.

Efficient one good quality appliance Nice product Sturdy well made Fantastic product I m using it from last 10 days and it is working good. Value for money. Quality product,Best Only issue is that you might misjudge its size. It s kind of too big especially if you re living in hostels like me. Using it for anything other than boiling water usually turns out to be pretty inconvenient for that reason. Even washing it at times. But overall quality is really good. It s a good product only suitable for specific use cases though. Good for homes. The kettle is very handy to use and the capacity of it makes the work easier. I loved the new colour choices they are offering. the size is sufficient and may be a bit large for single person usage. one suggestion is that a temperature control knob could have been provided in this price range. otherwise a very good product. finish is excellent. Takes a little longer duration for boiling The problem is the outer of kettle which easily charms the dust smudge no matter whatever available kitchen cleaning products u apply the blotch stains are signified to be permanent. Go for other than white colour. Very useful product and it is working good. Price is reasonable. Worth it.

Good and easy to use. Best Vaccum cleaner in this range Best vacuum cleaner for house hold use Nice,The decision to buy this2 Purely on The cost of similar branded item is around Rs16000 002 I use this Vacuum cleaner only occasionally and based on my need and I feel floor requires vaccum cleaning.Under the above condition this item serves purposeConssMade In China and they importing and marketing in India1 sound I feel not at my comfort zone but others also make similar noise2 lenth of power chord smaller compared to other brander ones3 No demo was arranged . YouTube video was their reply for my request for demo even in metro like Bangalore.4 No customer support or services in case instrument goes faulty over time in Bangalore.I donot know how they service the instrument over phone.who has to bear to the cost of transportation and how it will workoutProsWorks as per the specification. Suction power is good noise level ok free movement. There can be an improvement in the sponge quality since while using the blower the same gets sucked in the steel tub. Further if the company can provide a video on how to effectively use the product it would be great and also how to avoid pressure on the motor since the hose pipe bends while using the product. nice product. i liked suction power but on right side extra blowing out apart from blower side. i dont why and steel body build quality is too low. if small partical touch it ll get dent .its ok over all product is good. ok ok The suction power of the vaccum cleaner is really good only drawback is that after using it for some time I observed that the suction hose is leaking the air which is making a whistling sound. I tried reaching out the customer service and they informed me that the whistling sound when using the blower mode is quite normal. The outer container is made of steel and is of good quality. When I received the product I observed a dent in the body. Bought recently and initial usage is quite good. It s convenient and easy to use. Performs well on floors mattress and sofas. Blower function works as expected. A bit tough to clean mosquito mesh through grills. I have been using this vaccume cleaner for the last 1 month. And I am very happy with the product ...I have been using it mostly for Sofa Cleaning....it s suction power is really good. https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/61yO rOjccL.

I use my blender almost every day. But the construction of the blender is such that the food often falls below the blades and I am constantly readjusting the ingredients to get the ingredients blended. It can take a considerable amount of time and a lot of patience. But this immersion blender can puree fruits and vegetables in less than 2 minutes and do it evenly and consistently. It is easy to use and lightweight. Cleaning consists of removing the shaft with the blades and handwashing it. You can wipe off the handle with a damp cloth and stick both in a drawer. My standard blender requires thorough washing of the various parts pitcher blades screw on attachment and lid . So I am moving the standard blender from the counter to storage. If I need it I have it. I highly recommend this Powerful blender go for it.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/41QEK7WRJbL.

Good product and does the job as advertised. Autocut off is there but the power switch doesn t turn off automatically. it should be done manually which we can forget. Once cooled down this will turn on even water is not there. so switching off is mandatory. i have kept a smart plug with 20mins count down to overcome this issue. Overall it is a good equipment to boil eggs. But there should have been 1 change in button. It says automatic off but machine is not really off... It will restart again when machine cools down because power button was kept on.. Button should turned off automatically to avoid restart. Hence 1 star less. Used three times so far boiled 8 eggs each time and perfect results each time. Very happy with the product. Will provide long term review after couple months. Thanks Amazon. Thanks Borosil.

Bar Pressure: 4 bar. Function select knob :Yes Includes: Coffee maker Instruction manual Customer care list and Guarantee card,Manish Holla SuperPlayer117 Sudeepmirza Amba vasantha lashmi Swati Damaitre Amazon Customer Amazon Customer,Sufficient for a Family Makes superior coffee almost par with those brewed in CCD value for money Nice Doesn t justify the Description Good for the price Unnecessary Buy Delivery without Warranty Card,This machine can easily brew coffee for a family of 4 6 members at a time. Some people asked whether this can be used in a cafe. The answer is simple NO . Reason is that this isn t a sophisticated machine like a professional commercial grade coffee brewer.Now my experience with this machine was good. And a bad thing was that I did not get the steam pipe sleeve. Except that everything was well packed. When you buy this machine make sure to rinse the internal passage. throw the first water from the machine. thoroughly wash the caraffe puck filter and measurement spoon. Remember to NEVER USE dishwash gel or soaps to wash carafe puck or anything such. It may ruin the coffee aroma.Method efficient as per my opinion :1. Fill the water in tank. No need to measure it as it can be controlled with the selector. Don t run it dry. It may damage the heating element or pump.2. Switch ON the machine. After that pour the ground coffee powder inside the filter level it and press it to compress. I use 1:2 ratio. 1 spoon of coffee powder to 2 spoon of water at output.3. Before changing over to drip mode open the steam valve and check if sufficient pressure is built. Placing carafe under the puck slowly move the selector till Europa and quickly back it to steam icon. This will let the coffee bloom inside. After 5 7 seconds slowly move the selector upto Espresso. The decoction should be not too slow or not too runny.4. Wait till your desired quantity is reached and quickly change the selector to steam mode.5. Take milk in a tumbler which is slightly larger than the level of milk. Place the tumbler under the steam pipe such a way that the tip should immerse just slight under milk meniscus. Slowly open the steam valve located at the side. Steam it as per your need.6. Mix the milk and decoction. That s itRemember to not uncap the top lid after usage as there may still be pressure inside. Open the steam valve and let all the pressure get released.Coffee used: Bombay Island Espresso grind Medium Roast. Use only espresso grind or maybe south indian filter grind. Don t use Aeropress V60 or any other grind as it may not produce desired taste.I personally like this machine. For the price it s good and build quality is Moderate. Please watch some YouTube videos if you are new to coffee machines. It s very very easy to ruin coffee without proper knowledge. You may also watch James Hoffmann. He is World Barista Champion and shares tips about coffee. I m a fan of espresso. Every time I go to a coffee joint I tend to order a doppio A double shot espresso . But those prices are way too high if I wished to drink a cup of espresso twice everyday. So I ve decided to buy this machine. One thing to say the quality and durability depends on the user. If you take care the machine would take care of your cup of joe.So how do you properly clean this thing is the question raised by many guests after seeing.1. Always rinse the drip tray2. Use 10% dish washing liquid with 90% water to clean the carafe3. Do not hit the filter basket to drop the used grounds. Run water over it forcefully to loosen the grounds. This is crucial because dents can affect quality4. Before and after your brewing activities make sure that you clean the internals. To do this fill the carafe till the 4 mark with bottled water. Assemble an empty perma filter. Switch on and set the strength to max. In about a minute you can see steaming hot water flow into the carafe. Check its color. If it s yellow then rinse and repeat. If it is white dry everything and switch it off. Then either do your coffee brewing or assemble it back and call it a day.5. Always let the steam out. When you froth milk immediately wipe off the residual milk with a lint free clothWARNING: NEVER EVER USE HARD/TAP WATER. IT CAUSES SERIOUS LIME SCALING ISSUES WHICH CAN GREATLY AFFECT THE TASTE QUALITY OF YOUR COFFEE. IT MAY ALSO CAUSE DIGESTIVE ISSUES. ALWAYS USE SOFT CAN WATER THE WATER MUST NOT TASTE SALTY OR SWEET . TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. PLEASE DO NOT POST MISLEADING REVIEWS STATING THAT MY MACHINE BROKE.THE STEAM KNOB IS THE WORST PART OF THIS MACHINE. THE MACHINE WAS USED JUST FOR 14 DAYS. THEN THE STEAM KNOB DECIDED TO LOOSEN UP AND FALL OFF. I CALLED THE SERVICE CENTER. THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT THERE. THE PROBLEM IS I M JUST 17 AND I CANT DRIVE. AND THE SERVICE CENTER IS FAR AWAY. SO I REMOVED THE RUBBER CASKET AND FIXED THE KNOB DIRECTLY. IT COMES OFF BUT I THINK I LL USE IT ONLY TO EASE THE PRESSURE BECAUSE I ALWAYS DRINK IT BLACK. BUT THIS ISSUE MAKES ME REDUCE A STARTips for using the machine.1. Use fine grounded coffee. I use Narasu s PB or Royal Elite Bold. Currently I m using Phalada Pure Sure Organic Coffee Powder. For the best results you must grind the coffee on your own. If you can t make sure the coffee is fresh. Mind that using instant coffee powder or using coffee mixed with chicory can lead to disaster both for the machine and your stomach respectively. You can also go for Lavazza. But it makes a hole in your wallet deeper than the Mariana Trench.2. Only use good quality bottled/can water.3. Maintain a good cleaning discipline4. In case you ve used hard/tap water immediately do a descaling. Refer your instruction manual.5. Always tamp your ground in the filter. You must apply about 30 pounds of force. This is about 13 kg of force. Hold the force for about 6 seconds and slowly rotate the tamper before removing it. Make sure the filter lock is up when doing thisAs you can see this is a real espresso maker. It produces crema provided that you use fresh and the correct coffee. For me it produced about 4 mm crema for a double shot. This is good for a steam driven machine. Note that this is a steam driven machine. You can never get the finish of coffee joints because they use dual boilers powered by thermoblock pumps. Although the tastes would be similar provided you use the correct beans.Please look at the pics to see the finish. The cirrus clouds like crema was from coffee powder a week old. The brown and rich crema is from that organic coffee powder I ve just bought. Can you notice the finish being directly proportional to the freshness This applies even to taste. The white crema cup tasted a bit bitter and left a bittery taste in my mouth. The brown crema cup tasted like coffee at its best leaving a crisp and nutty taste. Also after I did some research I came to know that an espresso must have three layers. A bitter crema a sweet middle and a nutty acidic bottom. You must mix these before drinking to have the best shot. If you see the glass picture I ve attached you can clearly see those layers.OVERALL THIS IS A GREAT ESPRESSO MACHINE FOR A BEGINNER. IT MAKES GREAT ESPRESSO AND IT IS ECONOMICAL TOO. AS I SAID IF YOU TREAT THE MACHINE WELL THE MACHINE WOULD TREAT YOUR CUP OF JOE WELL. Being a coffee enthusiast the product fits in my requirement.Easy to use. Time taken is reasonable. Adjustment of intensity works well.Frothing tool is very good... though i prefer black coffee frothing helps getting a perfect creamy coffee for my guests. Nice product The coffee strength nob is a mythBut itne paise me itna is good Very happy with the machine works fine and easy to operate unfortunately it wasn t packed very well buy the seller so the plastic spoon that came with the machine was broken everything was packed in the original box with only one tape to secure the box. It makes the whole process of making coffee more difficult. Also was shocked to know this is not covered under Amazon s return policy. My bad I didn t check and now I am stuck with this. Life is no better after you buy this. Coffee maker delivered without Warranty Card Instruction manual,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/31M TYWPdQL.

Correct spare Great water cleanser ABC,Prestige water purifier cartridge is obviously good. But it lasts very less number of days. It doesn t even last more than 2.5 months for 2 people. Also the MRP is cut off and it is sold at a higher price. This Product normal sediment water filter but not long use So All customers you go to electric RO UV Water Purifier I am suggested v guard Kent Havells Brands I wonder if the product is genuine because the cartridge that came with the filter ran for over a year. After that the ones i received worked for about 2 months only. I m now looking for a Prestige service center from where i hope to get authentic product. I order it for my prestige tatva non electric water filter. But it s not working properly. Water is not filtering and company is not giving any solution and saying it s not covered under warranty. My 600 rupees is totally wasted. I m not expecting it from prestige company. These filter cartridges are replace in three months. Easy to replacr All great but it lasts only for like 4 6 months max.

Bad product. Fan makes lot of noise Its good with a flaw Overall best. Number 1 works decently.,Perfect for room heating ..... Noiseless Silent instant heating within 30 seconds. Easy to carry just a small suggestion that it should have left and right wind blower also instead of only up and down. Best product not saying it in this range but I have used others also this is the best till date. Even some time we use it as heat massager also as wind flow is awesome so sometime for back pain or knees it s a perfect product. Anyone of buying for the first time or buying for a better experience will recommend to go for this. Its almost 60 days of usage now. And yes easy to clean also. I have a dog and she also enjoys it... I got a 15 month old used heater not a new one.The fan is making a too much noise. It is a defective or a damaged piece.I got it on 18th Dec 2022. When I try to request a replacement I am told the return window is closed.If Amazon / Seller is sending a 15 month old used defective product should they at least not have the responsibility to at least get it replaced. I have been using ptc heaters for a few years now and have been happy with their performance and longevity usha orpat .So decided to buy one more this year saw this one had the highest rating. Bought it. Saw that its basically made by bajaj.Anyway its good looking and all seemed fine. But i started noticing a flaw with the thermostat. Normally there is always a hysteresis in the thermostat dial it turns on at one point and turns off a little further back. But this one was turning On and OFF at exactly the same point. Then i started observing that if the thermostat was on it simply remained on. If it was off it remained off. Tried it multiple times and realised that the thermostat doesnt work. So finally returned it.Overall power consumption is as expected around 1.4KW at low and 2KW at high. Good Very nice product..... good for a room of small size upto 150 sqft warms rooms within an hour and takes about 2 for a room of 200 sqft. its really light weight and silent in operation. has different settings for fan speed and hot/cold air. the only drawback is that it wont work for a big room or hall area. overall a good product .,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/41nYaR0z9fL.

It s a bit difficult to insert cells. Worked well for a month Extremely useful Waste product Value for money,It s good and easy to use The product appears cheap but works alright. As you might know from the product description there are speed settings. Decent product for this price range. Its very nice n poweful but needs proper care n cleanup after every use also u should keep changing batteries when u see the power low. Been using it for years now however 1piece lasts for about a year if taken proper care. The compartment to insert cells should have been a little bigger. It might break while trying to squeeze the cells in. This a useful product.. very easy to use and clean. Looks very light but is of good quality. Froths milk efficiently.. a must buy if you like frothy coffee or milk . Waste product.don t buy this by its brand name or by its price.very delicate product. This is certainly a great product.

Sandeep Yadav,Go for it Good steam iron Plage big size Good Product and worth Buying Nice Easy to use Good Going good so far,Writing this review after a month of use.Works absolutely fine i use it for my tailoring projects. I had a question regarding water dripping bt the company was prompt to send salesman and resolve my queries. Also a tip that I have heard from alot of technician and sounds logical to increase the life of ur machine is to use filter was. Tap water has alot of impurities and gets stuck and reduces the life of iron. I have seen that myself with my other steam iron as it leaves small dust particles on the waterstorage area. So do that will solve leaking issues if u ought to have any Wanted a heavy steam iron. This works very well. Lots of steam and easily irons out clothes. Very easy on fabrics too so you are able to use the high steam setting to remove out wrinkles on clothes without worrying about the fabric setting too much.. Easy to Use and All types of Clothes Nice it s did it s purpose nicely. Happy Cup to pour water must have been included Heat up very quickly no water dripping steam is good and don t stick. I use filter water to keep it clean,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/4145oJH y0L.

Does it s job properly. Roller doesn t come out if you scroll it properly. Adhesive is good in removing febric lints. Doesn t come with a cover but you can keep the used sheet wrapped till next use. Then you can remove it to get fresh sheet. Easy and handy. Works but adhesive could have been better. It s exactly as the pictures of the product. The roller works well and does the job. Go for it if you need one. I have pets at Home cats and I need to use this everyday.Will definitely re purchase The roller and the frame is loosely tied and cuts hand every time I use. The whole roller disassembles quickly while in use. The adhesion is not very good and finishes when rolled 2 3 times. I ordered this because my pet s hairs always stick on my clothes. This product removes those hairs easily. But in one jeans or shirt you need at least two sheets and also the roller comes down which make cuts on fingers. So for cleaning really good but not at all easy to use. Easy to use. Can go for it,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/31t6ATbG1jL.

Can be a Great Product Super Works as described though difficult to refill water good one Amazing,Apart from it leaving a watermark on table it s been a good experience. Good product but one issue i found that the head from where cool mist air comes should be flexible to rotate to any direction. Now suppose you are keeping in table and sitting on chair then all cool mist will go above instead of coming to you. my sleep quality improved by this product and it gives the feeling of freshness. Operating Manual inadequately written. The 2nd diagram is not labeled water filling method not mentioned.Most importantly the cord length is too small why being so thrifty. Most switch boards are at about 5 ft height. Cord does not support this height. As said can be a great product. Nice product The quality of the product is normal. Very thin plastic. Refilling water is a tricky job as we have to fill it up side down. The instructions are not clear. If the product is tilted a little it behaves differently. The LED lights are delicate and I think loose as well its an awesome product ...humidifier helped my baby to sleep better due to nasal congestion ... so relieved as a mother,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/21Kb8kWuKTL.

Nice little room heater. Metal body with carbon heating element Needs some care to handle when carry and use good,The product arrived on time and in good condition.It is not only portable but also convenient as it uses a standard plug that can be plugged into normal 5Amp sockets.I mostly just use it to heat my bathrooms as its a low wattage heater and thus can only work well in tiny spaces.IMPORTANT If using in bathroom ensure there is NO water on the floor or spraying on/around it. Just heat the bathroom and then move away the heater before using the bath area It s a light weight easy to use product.Perfect for small space.Heats quickly. Best room heater in budget especially it uses less power nd gives sufficient heating even can be used with inverter in places where power cut is a problematic issue. Not so easy to use or regular movement. I liked this room heater. It only uses 500 watts and so can be plugged into any 5 amps. It s quite as there is no fan. Adequate for a small room. It looks good and the feel is metalic. There is line indicator in its back and also there is a switch on its side. Heating feels powerful and there is no breathing issue due to this heater.

Abhijin Janardhan Prashant,Decent product doesn t pick up sand Ok ok Must Buy Good one for basic use with normal suction power Super First review Perfect product for my car,Does the job well doesn t work on sand. though the suction is very good the sand stays back no matter which lead you use. Ok ok Easy to use product I used it for the first time without knowing the know how of its use . Cleans almost 90% of your mess inside the car. Highly recommended. Pros: look and feel easy to hold and handle Cord length useful led light during night normal suction power but good enough for general useCons: noise is bit loud suction power could be better Good Hmm Strudy design quality accessories reputated brand.I have seen some car vaccum cleaners especially the low cost one s where dust comes out of machine due to poor locking mechanism so ofcourse you don t want the dust to be falling back when the sole purpose is to remove it You get what you pay for I have home vaccum clear from same company with has a good suction and does the job well I wanted a battery pluggable clearner where I can use it anywhere.Believe me no vaccum cleaner is good enough for heavily soiled cars so if you are expecting a commercial level cleaning the don t buy any.Car vaccum cleaner is a portable device which gives decent satisfaction but not a perfect I have seen some people who do not take out mats and just shove the cleaner in it and say it s not good.Mats need to be take out which actually collects big dust and derbies this poor small machine can t handle a 100% cleaning on that.If the car is heavily soiled the you must get it cleaned at a professional clearner then start using the small one.I found this to be doing the job when compared to my house vaccum clearner.One thing I observed was the wires was getting hot and has a soft component which makes it even thinner when it s hit but I think I can handle the job accessories quality is good and fir and finishe is good.I did not seen any dust seeping through the compartment and it was well contained in the dust chamber.Suction is decent and you can give almost a clean and tidy look to your car with this machine again a professional grade cleaners can doa good job which cost nothing less tha 15K.I would say worth a buy it used delligently by not expecting too much.I only hope if the company can provide a bag to carry it for the price or find one in your own which can fit your needs.

Handle length is too good you can use whole dram Very fast heating,no doubt product is good but after 2 month product auto power cut funtion not working so try to claim warrenty but havells said talk to amazon and amazon said talk to havells both the comany raise our hand. by the way product gave 2 year warrenty but they gave me only excusses. very bad experiences with havells. never expected Its good the ony pro and cons can be the flap ..Pros us can say is that the flap can be used for wider bucket of water for heating Cons u can say is the again the flaps bcoz while not in use flaps must be closed and you can t hang the heater anywhere bcoz there is no option given . Flaps can cause issue bcoz it have to be kept on the ground while not in use ..Rest all is good . Auto cut feature is best Cord length is shortEnergy efficiency good Temperature control too good I realt like the design and auto shutoff features of the product. But there s is also design flaw that you can t insert it into the half filled bucket and water should be full. Awesome Very good product Energy efficiency is ok not good,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/21TQo2rZRbL.

Product arrived in under 24 hrs...yet to test it Good Quality Very nice Don t know why I waited so long to get this Value for money Good quality could have been somewhat lower in price,Overall nice poduct just one problem is that is the cord length only rest awesome. Easy to clean and easy to handle. We used this for sandwich making and it performed well. The plates for grill and waffle making are readily interchangeable. The cord length is adequate although slightly longer cord would have been great.The device is readily portable because of its size and weight. Overall very useful. https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/71cciIOHxUL. SY88.jpg The quality of product is good Used a couple of times .....and sandwitch came good I wanted a sandwich maker and refused to buy one from a store since it was all 2k 4k and didn t have half the features that i was looking for. Saw this and love iBell as an upcoming Indian brand own an electrical sander too so didn t think twice and got this. Don t regret it one bit Pros are the 3 interchangeable plates for different ourposes. Grill one is just fantastic to hear all kinds of sandwiches and rolls and other food. All the plates are easily removable and washable too. Only con that i saw to this was the latch wasn t properly latching while making a heavily loaded sandwich in the sandwich maker. Otherwise it s a top of the range product in comparison with other big brands All the 3 functionalities works pretty well. Only thing is it should have had auto switch off feature. Nevertheless it is a very good product and worth the money. Sandwich also gets made fast. I ordered vguard removable plates sandwich maker but it came in faulty. The plates eject button had an issue. Later I ordered this one as was recommended by someone I know. It s of good quality only that could have been somewhat lower price,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41iHB nmy8L.

User friendly blender Recommended to buy nice products,Not sufficient power the product is more like a toy for kids. can t use it as a proper juicer. power back up is very poor. Ok I had to replace this product first time because it was leaking and now after replacement the new one has no battery backup and vibrates too much.The MRP is above 2000 rupees which is not at all justfied by the product.After buying the product I found that with the product they are giving a cashback offer of 25 to 100 rs if you give 5 star review probably that s why it has good ratings. I feel I was fooled by the ratings. Waste product as the juicer is leaking which creates the whole place mess and the juicer doesn t grind properly where the pieces of fruits remain ungrinded. I generally dont write reviews but i was forced to write this one as this is just waste of moneySpend it wisely for something better It s does not work properly at all after charging for 4 hours the battery last only 30 45 sec. Very bad product.And they have given a cashback coupon to attract good rating.Misleading information is given on the detail page. I bought this mostly for milk shake and it does an amazing job and it is affordable but it didn t worked while charging User friendly blender very useful for the pg accommodaters.

Jana Amazon Customer Viknesh Harren,Okay to use Good value for a well finished product recommended Do not buy this product Better than expected. Best carafe from amazon Build quality is not that great Replacement parts not available or sold for twice as much as the value of the entire product Good product,The pricing is good using is very easy but the product is not too much worth to buy. I have been using a similar coffee percolator for over 20 years now and my old workhorse a Chinese Nova is still capable. Since it was white and therefore a very unappetising sight now I needed a new one.Packaging: The design of packaging was perfect stiff corrugated sandwich board box foam profiled panels stuck on board for bottom and top board wrapping around the glass kettle the whole unit inside a thick ply cover. Frankly this sort of packaging is more common in high end audio equipment. 5 plus for the packaging design.Size: This is a small machine and will make about 600 ml of coffee sufficient for 2 mugs in one go. If you need a larger volume look elsewhere.Body and finish: The plastic body is well made the matte finish looks good. The bottom metal plate is seamless and black will have to wait and see when spots appear. The kettle is good quality glass and though no branding is present feels thick enough to withstand minor washing bumps. The filter bucket and the holder with the flow control spring is OK hopefully the spring and washer which are fixed will last. The lid moves smoothly and the hinges and the sprinkler also look sturdy. Switch is firm.Function: It worked very well on the first use. I had used an extra coffee filter paper on top of the nylon filter bucket. The flow was smooth. Coffee liquor starts weak and then picks up strength. The drip stops well with the removal of the kettle and though the manual cautiously states a 10 sec gap for drip stop I did not find any leakage on longer removal.Overall: Very satisfied with my new coffee maker. Recommend buying. Product doesn t work within a month Easy to use and it turned out better than I expected it to be for the price. Just Magnificent. Saves lot of time. The plastic quality for this product is poor. It feels like a toy. I had bought a Amazon basics air fryer it had great build quality comparing to this Amazon basics product If you try to find a replacement part it costs twice its value its cheap and breakable. And the coffee is very very light waste of coffee and also not a good flavour. Nice product and simple to use,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41EuzetRjTL.

Headquartered in Delaware USA the vision is to make an Indian owned world class brand of home appliances that competes with the largest multinationals in the most advanced countries ie: the USA Europe Middle East by offering better product quality service delivery and value for money.,A.sh Jp Junaid Yaseen Maya sutar Andrabi praveen elangovan Satpreet Singh Amazon Customer,Best in its price range Best suction power Domestic Beast Very good suction power and efficient Beast of a Vaccum Cleaner Good built quality Nice product with good suction power Great Product,Purchased from Amazon for full price under no offers still beat competitors by Rs.163Order was placed on Thursday 01/12/22 late in the evening at 11 pm.Was to be Delivered on Thursday 08/12/22 but arrived early on Monday 05/12/22 at 10 am.Quite satisfied with the Delivery Packaging Condition of the item and also Happy with the early arrival.Along with the Vacuum we received a basic Instruction Manual and Warranty Card.The Invoice was missing from the parcel so it had to be downloaded from Amazon.To Register your Warranty you require to scan the Bar Code on the Invoice and WhatsApp the details.Without any delay excitedly we got to assemble the unit which was a fairly easy task took approximately 10 minutes which I guess is ok for the first time while getting familiar with all various attachments etc.First impressions the Vacuum itself looks sturdy built wise but some attachments could be a little stronger. Especially the extension pipes could be Stainless Steel same as the Drum and Telescopic in feature / operation. The main Vacuuming head attachment used for floor / hard surfaces could also be Stainless Steel as it gets used the most and gets banged around quite a bit would extend its life.Its a 2 pin plug instead of a 3 pin which could have been better with a surge protector fuse.The cord is of decent length quite impressed with the quality of the cord. Also the cord which has no autowind and cannot be inserted within the body of the unit after use can be rested on top of the Drum in a winding fashion it kinda works and does keep in place without being a nuisance. Hose same solution.The 2 side Latches are reasonably strong. Wheels are easy to install / insert and work fine.It would be absolutely fantastic if the various attachments could be stored / latched to the main unit while not in use storage wise but can understand the limitations in this regard.First demo was for the Vacuum.Noise average not too loud or unbearable reasonable with any other domestic Vacuum of similar power.Inside the lid the dust bag clings on to its inlet would be better if it could be secured / locked with a clip.In Vacuum suction mode the air gets forced out of the Blower outlet this outlet is directed on the opposite side of the unit and is directed straight onto the floor level. Now imagine if you had not yet cleaned that part of the room and that dust gets thrown around or blown onto the already cleaned surfaces it would be an unending job like a dog chasing its tail. If this outlet had a removable or having the ability to rotate something like a flap or adjustable Ac vents like in cars then it could direct the blown out air upwards while Vacuuming the surfaces and this could have been of great design sense.Suction is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing does the job which is important.Then follows the demo for the Blower.This feature should technically be equally as strong as the Vacuum because the force of the air sucked in while Vacuuming is supposedly the same force leaving the Blower outlet. To make things interesting there are fish gill like 2 vents on either sides of the Lid. These vents are the fixed kind cannot be closed or opened. One of the vent very faintly can be felt taking in air while the other vent blows out air at a significant force. This particular phenomena I am bewildered with cause as I understand the escaping rate of air through this vent will weaken the force supposed to leave the Blower outlet. So make of it what you will. Still does the job if you re looking at blowing leaves or scaring the neighbours pet.Finally the demo for the Wet.Performance is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts and as other customers have described in their video demonstrations again nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing does the job which is important. May need to dry mop even after using the Wet function.In closingDefinitely do purchase it use it often as required and also helps keeping fit Do not allow dust to settle on your Vacuum Blower.Also ordered extra:i American Micronic Replacement Dust Bag for AMI VCD21 1600WDx AMI VCD15 1600WDxii RODAK 35 MM Mattress and Upholstery Nozzle for Vacuum Cleaner Wet and Dry Cleaning EU Import It have the best suction power among the wet and dry vaccum cleaner even better than some of the dry vaccum cleaners. I bought this for my mother in law. She likes it for being easy to use. It s simple and easy to connect and remove dust covers and pipes Extension pipes are little loose though. It s easy to clean those cat hairs now. And don t have to worry about accidentally sucking the water from the floor because it s Wet and dry vaccum cleaner. Hope the customer care is a good one incase of any needs arise. They send me already opened package but not used I think. They could have send us a fresh unopened perfectly sealed package. No complaints untill now. I liked the reusable dust cover feature also it s easy to connect it inside. Easy to handle don t have too much weight.It would have been better if there was an auto winding of power cables with a switch. This is a domestic beast.... great suction.Only thing that should had been ther is speed control.Noise level is high but with such suction is ok. As long as it cleans it all without ne to redo it again and again I am ok...Rest how it will stay with time will be something to see. It is very easy to clean as the suction power is great very powerful machine indeed I have been looking for a good vaccum cleaner for a long time now. I recently came across this and read the reviews etc. Some were good and some were bad. But at the same time I couldn t find any better specifications in any of the other vaccum cleaners in this price segment so I finally bought it.It came in a big Amazon box well packed and secured. Unboxed and it was as perfect as in the stock images. Here is the list for you to understand the pros and cons as easily as possible : Very Good quality steel and plastic build The suction 28kpa is really really good even with the thick carpets etc The wheels are really good too They move effortlessly You get a lot of accessories to clean different surfaces and they re good quality The blower function is really powerful The bag inside which collects the dust dirt is big and can be cleaned Washed easily The noise level isn t much. Its okay Not loud The cord length is 5mtrs which is enough The overheating protection is Good All the Accessories can be stored at the given spaces on the base Cons: The only thing that I think should be improved is the locking mechanism of the extension pipes. They are good and fit well but if its a carpet or some other mats you re cleaning you need to tighten it well otherwise it loosens and needs to be tightened again and again. Overall a 10/10 Product which fits all your needs Wet and Dry Cleaning of course .Better than any other Vaccum cleaners in under 10k price range . Go for it P.s I ve tried some other Vaccum cleaners too which are in the 6k and above range but this is the all in one OP Vaccum Cleaner Good suction with great built quality Good durability good suction power and quality product Vacuum cleaner is very fine suction power is quite good drying power is also just OK noise level is high as I expected. Cost is high as compared to other brands. Overall I rated it four star.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/41tcKYuBPSL.

PATENTED OZMO MOPPING TECHNOLOGY: With Unique OZMO Mopping that gives hand like mopping efficiency even stubborn stains can be easily cleaned.

SMART APP ENABLED ALEXA / GOOGLE COMPATIBLE: ECOVACS Smart App connectivity lets you control scheduling and monitoring cleaning status from the palm of your hand. Works with Alexa Google Assistant voice commands. BEST SUITED FOR INDIAN HOMES: A Vacuum and Mop Simultaneously in one go. No need to buy separate Robot for mopping B Covers Full House in one charge C Suitable for All Floor types especially Tiles Marbles Granite Wood etc ECOVACS BRAND: Undoubtedly ECOVACS is a leading Brand in Robotic Vacuum Cleaner category with excellence in R D Innovation.,Jaydeep Jayakrishnan R,A perfect balance of price and performance Great Suction and above average mopping Good Buy,Very happy with the product performance.Installation: Very easy to start using. Had to wait for 2 days for the technician but with the instructions from box you can start yourself without waiting.In the box: 10 disposable mops 1 washable mops 2 side brushes 1 main brush Mopping plate Deebot Dust chamber with HEPA filter Charging Dock Cable User Manual Cleaning BrushCleaning performance: Superb cleaning with 4 power options Quiet Normal Max and Max . Lower suction means lower battery consumption. With higher suction power even the minutest dust particles will be cleaned up Good if you have children in the house . Higher suction also means you need to clean the dust chamber more frequently. In all the 4 power options the house will look clean and will collect most visible dust. The higher options are for deep cleaning. Also if you have groves or areas that accumulate dust over time in the flooring the higher power will pull out dust from these tiny places.Cleaning Pattern: 1st edges of the room are cleaned and then it will run a north south or east west cleaning pattern inside the edges. No specific patterns like Y or Spiral Mopping Performance: The mopping also has electronically controlled water usage Low Medium High Ultra High. The app shows warnings when using High and Ultra High The robot may slip due to water on the floor but I have been using High water flow on ceramic tiles and have not faced such a problem. The wheels of the robot have good grip which help with the higher water settings. The mopping will become more and more effective over time with usage of the reusable mopping pad As it gets older more area will touch the floor than a new mopping pad. For the 1st week the mopping is not as good as the mopping pad does not entirely touch the floor but with usage the shape of pad will adapt and you will get better results. Corner Cleaning: 1 2 cms of wall corners may not be cleaned esp. if you don t have straight walls E.g. if you have a bathroom door which has a 1 cm cutout in the wall then the corner area around the door might not be cleaned . 90 degree wall corners may have a 1 2 cm area which is not cleaned however the side brushes are large enough for most of these corners. All other areas with obstacles such as chair or table legs will be properly cleaned Deebot may run around them 2 or 3 times .Corner Mopping: As the Deebot s mop is round it will not reach the corners expect a 5 6 cm area in the 90 degree wall corners not being mopped. However on straight walls the cleaning is very effective as it may only miss 1 2 cms which however will be cleaned by side brushes.IMPORTANT: If you have black furniture Black stone / wall tiles mirrors or any reflective furniture at the height where Deebot s Top mounted laser is located the corner area near that black furniture will not be cleaned by Deebot. The laser is not able to properly recognize that it is a wall and will run a few centimeters away from that wall. This is important to consider if you have substantial amount of blacks in your house as the cleaning will be less effective.Mapping: The 1st run will map the entire house and you need to follow Deebot as it maps so that no areas are obstructed. Subsequent runs will update the map with any obstacles e.g chairs and tables if they were not initially mapped. The N8 version does not have additional sensors as the pro version. So it may crash into smaller items that the top mounted laser cannot directly see. Also you can save at maximum of 2 maps at a time 2 floors . The 1st run will be a very random cleaning pattern. After the 1st run you can edit the rooms Divide or merge areas and rename the rooms based on some preset options like Living room bed room kitchen etc. . Once the rooms are mapped Deebot will clean each room in the subsequent run and then you will be able to see proper cleaning pattern The created maps are not editable you cannot move or adjust boundaries . You have option to add virtual boundaries as a line or as a rectangle box where the robot should not go. This is extremely useful if you have mirrors or reflecting furniture at the height of Deebot. Deebot s laser reflects off the mirrors and assumes there is area of the house where it may be able to go behind the mirror . So you need to manually block this mapped area behind the mirror with a virtual boundary or box. Deebot will automatically detect carpets and not mop over them if you have installed mopping plate then Deebot will ignore carpet area . Also there is an option to mark areas as no mop areas Similar to Virtual boundary .Application Use: I used the android application for setup and regular cleaning functions. The app has an advanced mode which works as per the stored map. If you turn it off Deebot will start cleaning wherever you place it. E.g. I have a balcony which can t be accessed by the Deebot directly. I can pickup and place it in the balcony turn advanced mode off and start cleaning. Once it is done it will return to the place where you put it and notify that docking station is not accessible.The app also has 3 cleaning modes with advanced mode turned on. Area cleaning Select a room or multiple rooms to clean Auto clean Clean the entire house Custom Cleaning Select an area on the map to clean .You can preset the sequence in which you want to clean the rooms. You can also set different vacuum and water levels for each room or can use a common setting for the entire house . You can also preset how many times Options are once or twice you want to clean a specific room. You can also set multiple cleaning schedules based on which room you want to clean at what time of the day. Deebot will start working automatically. However this is not advisable if you are mopping. As per the technician you must remove mopping plate after use. If any water leaks onto the parts it may void warranty.There is an option to auto boost suction on carpets to Max . You can set the option for continuous cleaning i.e. whether you want Deebot to auto restart cleaning if it runs out of charge midway. Deebot will only recharge partially based on the remaining cleaning area resume the cleaning and then return to recharge this saves time The app also shows usage period of accessories in hours and the total expected usage time. It is an Ecovacs recommendation to replace the accessories Side Brush Main Brush HEPA Filter. This area of the app also shows how to clean or maintain with images which is really helpful.The app shows a history of cleaning cycles with maps. This helps to check if any areas were not cleaned.Cleaning and Maintenance: Expect that instead of cleaning the house daily you will be washing the mopping pad every day and Cleaning Deebot once every week depending on the size of your house . Cleaning will take around 30 to 40 minutes remove all hairs from side brush main brush and wheels remove the dust chamber remove the HEPA filter and wash the dust chamber Wash the main and side brushes if needed Clean all the sensors of Deebot with a dry cloth Let the washed accessories dry and then reinstall them. Also remember that the investment in a robot is not a onetime cost. You will need to replace the accessories every 6 12 months based on the usage and maintenance. Consider the replacement cost also while evaluating a price point for investment in a robot vacuum.Overall Rating: 9/10 The cleaning and mopping performance is very good and better than a house maid in most circumstances. E.g. Deebot goes under the sofas . Expect manual work such as clearing the rooms before running the cleaning cycle and cleaning areas out of reach of Deebot. In this price range I am very satisfied with the performance.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/31Ly7OehCGL.

Ashutosh Amazon Customer,Good Product Includes relevant attachments in this price point 2 in 1 is exactly what i needed Read the rest for pros and cons Value for money Apt vacuum cleaner for my requirements does the job Not so satisfying if you have other options to not choose it then go for that other option. Okay okay product Product is very nice and handy but heated after used of 10 minutes. Overall performance is good.,Nice product low noise and good suction power in price range received damaged packet and without hose pipe but over all product is good worth of money Received the product on time. Have used it once to clean and its easy to use works well. The heating concern mentioned by prior reviewers is apt however don t a damper for a purchase at this price. It s a decent product in the affordable category. The floor attachment Particularly works very well. It is light weight and so cleaning lower end of ceiling fans was easy. The suction power when using sofa attachment is quite good in cleaning dust stuck in stitching corners. Overall if you want to spend minimally and get all relevant attachments and your usage is for a 1 bed or a smaller sized apartment this product is a good start. Carpet bohot ache se clean nhi kar paata baaki normal cleaning ache se kar deta he. Got this vacuum cleaner after a lot of research and it has been a good choice till now. I wanted a handheld vacuum cleaner for both car and home cleaning purposes. My primary requirements were cleaning my car and gaming chairs/sofas. A car vacuum cleaner only wouldn t have suited the purpose. Also I wanted a power plugged vacuum cleaner as the one with a battery can be used only for a certain amount of time and there is a long charging period of wait.This product ticks all the requirements. It has a 5m power cable that is long enough to use comfortably. The suction power is good at 16kpa unlike the 6kpa of most battery powered cleaners. Noise is okay I mean it isn t so much to disturb someone until and unless someone is really allergic to noise.It has several components that helped clean my car and even my fabric gaming chair. And I was also able to see a visible difference in the window meshes.Yes it gets heated after several minutes of usage but I could use it with a wait of 2 3 minutes each time. Its weight is ample for horizontal and downwards usage. I haven t used the stick provided and I think it might be a little bit difficult to use it upwards on walls if I need to use it continuously for 10 minutes or more.I had to be sure that the accessories were available after purchase such as the filter which I was able to confirm with customer care. It s a good buy. Let s see in the long run.It s made in China. The company provides 6 months of an extended warranty if a review is given and shared with them. This is a bit weird requirement to go ahead with. However this isn t a sponsored review and is based on hardly a month s usage.Some photos are attached for help. Nice product but the filter strain was teared in one place it needed to repair. But otherwise satisfactory. Build quality is very deplorable they are just forcing the buyers to give 5 star by any means to give better service and warrenty assistance by a card inside the box this seems really threatening. But overall working of this machine is somehow ok.I would rather suggest if you have options to not choose it then go for that option. Good for surface cleaning build quality is not adequate but good to have at this price https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/81ix5q8WyWL. SY88.jpg,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/31RLcOp57gL.

Ok product. Not generating enough heat to pack Not up to the mark Pocket friendly effective and easy to use Average,Hi viewers so I bought this product after watching the endless hauls of amazonfinds. As much as I was excited for the use of the product it did not prove to be as useful. The sealing side does not heat enough for a packet to be sealed well. The cutter side works fine. But mostly the heating side has to be pressed upon so hard that the cell case opens up as it slides with the pressure of the thumb so I feel we can totally work without this product in our house. Its definitely stylish comes with a Manual Cells and a Hook to hang it but the slipping cell cover fails my convinience with it. Gud Easy to use worth the money When we press to seal lower part get open automatically Not heating enamous power to heat and pack the plastic cover Quality of the product is not good. The hold and press part for heating and sealing is not consistent. Sometimes it seals sometimes it burns the plastic. Also the seal comes off of right pressure is applied so it is not reliable too. The sealer quality is too good and it s sealing well. The only thing is you hv to press it hard while sealing.takes only few seconds to seal an entire packet. Good when you are travelling with a toddler and carrying lots of snack packets. Pocket friendly and cute Average working,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/21rLuqop7cL.

Shailesh Patel Cynthia Andrew Shijo Mathew Abraham anoop sharma,Good for now Worth Buying For Daily Cleaning Very strong Convenient and powerful hand vacuum Powerful suction of Product Good budget buy Powrrfully loaded for the purpose. Handy Vacuum Cleaner,Device was sturdy and handy suction power is quite strong all the attachments are good except the extension pipe was so weak that it gets crumpled when it comes in contact with any object. I bought this to get rid of dog hair on my bed and it does the job quite nicely. it gets rid of dust very easily. Very handy and durable product. This is VERY strong so while that is good for certain things it can also be a little difficult to vacuum as the it sucks in the surface making it difficult to glide along the surface.Also it does heat quickly so you have to keep pausing.however overall for this price it s quite an amazing buy. A good product that cleans dust from upholstery and floors. Variety of attachments help for different surface cleaning. Good suction capacity. Long cord makes it more useful since you can reach greater distances from the plug point. Only reason for 4 stars overall is that when using it some dust comes out from the collection compartment. The closing seal could be made more firm so that there is no air leakage out. Easy to suction the spider nest on the wall and other corner dust. Great product. Works great for the price it is coming for. As usual it is not a heavy duty vaccum so that means it is will get heated up... Give 5 mins break and use. Affordable and easy to use fits the purpose.

Ok I am updating my review hope it will get published and the who s and who of the brand will pay attention to it. After every two to three months the unit is having problem with the inlet system. Many a times the inlet stops taking water but the indicator shows tank filling It was rectified by the service person. Again now the indicator showing tank filling while the inlet valve is shut It should show the purple light means low or no pressure. It s a faulty unit. The installation guy and the service persons were right who stated that the faulty and low quality units are sold online whose statement I ignored thinking that every offline seller says so. Alas I was wrong. I want this unit to be removed immediately and want my hard earned money back. At this price this product is very suitable.

Best for instant heat water Amazing products Instant got water quite literally,I bought Havells 3lts Instant Geyser 4.5KW White/Blue and I m really happy I made this decision.Let me start with why I went for Instant Geyser instead of Storage Geyser . Storage geyser s have a tank to store water and heat it. For example a 10litre storage geyser fills up the 10 litre tank and then heats the water. As it has to heat high volume 10 lts of water it takes time of about 5 to 10 minutes Instant geyser s on the other hand heat water instantly within 1 to 3 minutes However the catch is they dont have a huge capacity tank which means at a given instant it has only small volume depending on tank capacity of hot waterNow who should opt for Instant Geyser and who should opt for Storage Geyser is the question If you like to have a Shower Bath for which you require more than 10 litres of hot water continously then you should go for Storage Geyser since storage geyser of capacity more than 10lts will store 10lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pauses Instead if we consider Instant Geyser of 3lts capacity for shower bath it cant provide you 10lts of hot water continously because for every 3lts it takes time to heat water again Hence for a shower bath better to go for Storage Geysers If you like to have a Bathtub Bath then instant geyser s are good to go because Consider using a bathtub a bathtub generally is of capacity 350lts If you even use a Storage Geyser of high capacity as much as 25lts still you will have 14 pauses of 5 to 10minutes each Because at one shot this storage geyser can provide you only 25lts of hot water continously and then you will have to wait for 5 10mins for the next 25lts to heat So to fill the entire bath tub you need to have 14 times 25lts of hot water 350lts So the total wait time would be 14 times 7mins on an average 98mins In this scenario of Bathtub bath its better to go for instant geysers since they provide hot water almost instantly and eventhough there will be pauses for every 3lts of hot water still the pauses being very small you ll have a bathtub full of water with enough amount of heat/hotnessThen you might ask what should we consider for Bucket Bath Both Storage geysers of 15lts or above and Instant geysers of 3lts or above are good to go Just choose based on: Price Time taken to heat instant takes less time Energy consumption instant comsumes less Now coming to Havells 3lts Instan Geyser of 4.5KW why I bought this Havells is a great brand I wanted to have it for Bathtub Bath 4.5KW heats 3lts of water in just 30 to 50secondsWhat I liked about this product: I have been testing it from a week and it is really ossum as it is heating 3lts of water in just 45seconds I have used a timer to note that The installation was totally free however remember you will be charged if there is any Plumbing Work do be done. No need to buy any extra accesories like pipes everything is provided in the box you just need to buy a 16amp plug which would be less than 100rs As soon as the product was delivered by amazon I got a message from havells saying they have registered my installation request and the very next day the instalaltion was done thanks a lot Havells This might differ for you based on your location I live in hyderabad I really like havells customer service The geyser comes with 2 years of warrenty for the whole and 5yrs of warrenty on the tank It has Auto Cutoff feature to stop further heating or wastage of electricity if you forgot to switch off however please switch it off once done because eventhough it has auto cutoff still once the water in the tank cools down it will again start heating and the cycle repeats It shows color indication: Blue when its heating and Orange when it has done heating Have a look at the pictures I have attached Note: Go for the 4.5kw model if you want hot water instantly in 30 to 50seconds the 3kw model might take 2 to 5mins to heat 3lts of water Make sure it is 4.5kw model because I see reviews from other customers who say the Mustard colored geyser is not 4.5kw but 3kw better go for white and blue color to be sure Very nice product Good product 4.5KW rated heater is able to heat water in minutes and maintain that temperature for continuous flow of hot water. Good product Great product at great price. Value for money and instantly warm water comes in just 2min Havella water heater Water heats up in 45 60 secs depending on the weather.This review is after using this water heater continuously for 10 12 days in December in Kolkata with one of the days being extremely windy and lowest temperature at 14 15 degree Celsius during afternoon/ early evening hours . On the coldest day so far it took around 1min 10 15seconds to heat up completely.If you don t have chronic pain or arthritis or this is not going to be used for very old people whereby really hot water is required for bathing I think it can work perfectly for winters with lowest temperatures upto 9 10 degrees because I have chronic pain and use this to get really hot water and for a shower not using a bucket and it s manageable.Obviously can t be compared to steaming hot showers using a storage geyser but this heats quite quickly so can be used in the shower even with the low capacity.For that same reason it can be used for multiple people because by the time one person leaves the bathroom and the next enters you ll have fully hot water only of lesser quantity so if you don t live someplace cold or don t need very hot water but mildly hot water this can be used for multiple people as well.Installation support was also good.No cons only that if Havells introduces a 5l instant heater in the 4.5kW range then that would be a game changer and might give storage geysers a run for their money because this is perfect for anyone who doesn t have their own home and might need to move around because it s compact and provides instant hot water.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/31991seDfcL.

I must say area of improvement would be selling details need to be update. Build quality area off improvement and the battery charging indicator as well should also show how much battery is remaining that feature is also missing in the variant I received.Can purchase this product and can give it try for me it s working doing the job. I ordered black one but get a white. Build is not good as I think. Easy to clean. It is indeed a good product the only thing that can be improved is speed adjustment buttons as it starts directly at the full speed you can reduce the speed but it should be in an increasing order Speed Button The power adjusting buttons are great.Froths in only two minutes. One charge can hold up to 12 times od frothing Totally worth the price I ordered this product for beating coffee but this product is also best for mashing eggs lassi making and other kitchen works also.

Great quality garment steamer Superb Superb supportive good for garment,The product does it s job really well. Just feels a little heavy. It is easy to use and wrinkle free and happy for using first time. Thank you Amazon. Good product First of all I really like the color of this iron. This is so cute to hold and use it. I was little worried about the performance but I tried this on daily basis for good 5 days so far and the cloths are really neat and wrinkle free. I feel this is little bulky as compared to the iron that I used from my friends in the past but otherwise this is a good travel iron. Now I don t have to worry about ironing lots of cloths before travelling to somewhere. 2 level steam adjustment allows better control to obtain optimal results and Easy refill large 1.8 ltr water tank suitable for long steaming sessions and Powerful 2000watt all aluminium heating element for fast even heating and Double anti dry design for comprehensive heat damage protection I m really satisfied the product. This steamer works like magic. I just used hanger for cloths and used it.Very useful for fast instant ironing.Need to press button for steam.All you need is little patience. Do it slowly.Wall on background helps.Don t put hands on opposite sides of clothes it s temperate is high. The results are evident. All your bulky clothes can be ironed pretty easily with this. A small amount of water is enough to iron a blazer or even a lehenga. The efforts have become minimal. It s a modern day treat to have this at your home. The price when compared to others is kept minimum. The warranty is pretty much handy extra six months I used it for the first time in my life. And wow it just worked like any normal iron It is handy portable and fast enough to do the wrinkle free garments.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/21df9THeM L.

Turns out the cap was actually a pretty nice container to blend small amounts of anything. The container itself seems of great quality has measurements on the side and also comes with a lid so that nothing splatters outside when you re using the blender.2 There is also a holder with some nails if you wanna mount the blender on a wall.3 The blender itself is amazing to hold looks great and is pretty easy to use.4 The blender can even stand on its own if you have to leave it and attend to something else. If you place it vertically you can leave it as it is.Cons:1 After over 15 seconds of continuous blending that is if I m not just pulsing it but continuously blending there is this smell of some sort that starts to come from the blender. I m not sure if that s a sign of overheating or if it s normal.2 There s this groove right above the blade and every time I m done washing there s always a little residue that was hiding in that groove which always comes out a few seconds after I m done washing and I always have to go back to clean that. So that s a small inconvenience.But it s overall great and I d highly recommend getting this product Good Making the life easy. Great durability and original products Very nice product for small or moderate usage. Good product Very good Very useful product in day to day work,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/31l0oxTSJuL.

It maintains fixed temperature enabling fermentation process. I gave one star less because it does not have any handles so holding the apparatus can be tricky as it has this smooth surface so it might slip off from hands. You have to be very careful while holding and handling this curd maker if they give side handles and auto cut off feature then it would be best. Package arrived in good condition. Now need to contact company for warranty Good product to settle hassle free yogurt. Only thing is it should automatically cut of power once yogurt is ready. Else yogurt tastes amazing. Got the product looks good... checking now I am writing this review after using the product for three weeks. I have chosen this as Agaro Brand seems to be more trustworthy and has 1.5 years warranty 1 year 6 months extra after registering Good Things It works as expected. For my taste and local weather conditions it takes nearly 6 hours. This will vary based on individual taste and local weather conditions. Very light weight. Cleaning is easy and there is no problem even if there is a bit of spill.Not So Good Things Quantity is not 1.2 liters it is few ml more than 1 liter.Plastic covers are delicate and there is chance of them getting damaged while cleaning. In my opinion manufacturer should have a provided a optional spare set of covers.Considering the cost build quality is sufficient as it is Made in China Length of the wire is 94cms and usually requires an extension Good product Good product It s just amazing. This sentence is enough to comment for this unique thing.I never ever had ever imagined to make yogurt in quick time and even in winter without any compromise in taste.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/310umqMFDRL.

Very nice product worth it Best vacuum cleaner It s a really good worthy product Simply superb,Suction power mentioned no where on product spec or packaging. But surprisingly it s having good suction do most of the cleaning effortlessly.I purchase 3ltr version which having button to control suction.It s some what true that suction reduced when dust cylinder is somewhat full. But I resolved issue by emptying dust cylinder and cleaning filters.It s somewhat tricky to remove cylinder itself for cleaning do it carefully ow u will break plastic locks.It s very similar to midea vaccum cleaner available in uk with 16kpa.All extension pipes are of steel make is it difficult to work with due to weight.Btw it don t have blower function.The price of product and performance make it best buy vacuum. It s worth for the price given and does it s job perfectly only concern on my personal experience I had was the extension cord provided is made of steel and it s bit heavy and we can t hold it for long while cleaning the spider webs in roofs rest all good Suction power is okayish. Its a good product value for money but can do much better with a good suction power. It doesn t remove most of the dust takes too much effort It is a good choice if you are looking for a vacuum cleaner under 5k. It is worth for the price. nice product worth the money Suction power is good cord length sufficient for home purpose noise level is also low right now Please go for it.

I have used Siemens iron already and it s not working so on emergency ordered this model from this brand. Both brands are varying in specific parameters. Bodywise BD iron box is small in size. So it took little extra time in closing a single apparel iron. Weight also lighter. Steam consumes water very quickly like I used 100ml twice for 3 apparels..

Add this heater to your designated space for warmth it optimises productivity while also saving energy.,Vivi nyuthe Amazon Customer Bala Mahesh Yadav Thotakura Sunil Singh Thoughtful user Anuj Mamta Vikas,A1 AWESOME PRODUCT Room heater2900watt need separate power connection Not upto the mark. Probably the best build in this category. A good heater with some additional amazing features which make it a best buy Not as expected Nice product,Perfect for winter MEETS ALL MY REQUIREMENT Good but expensive product with working process Since I have tried Bajaj 13 fins oil heater this 11 fin heater is not worth it. The quality is good just for the looks however the fins are very thin and unable to produce the same heat with same power as Bajaj.Although I am comparing it with Bajaj 13 fins still the room size was 12x10ft and borosil heater really struggled to even put the room to a comfortable temperature. With Bajaj it was done within half hour however borosil took even 2 hrs and still we were feeling uncomfortable.The fan placement is low and it doesn t converts that much heat for faster heater even with max settings.Please check both physically if possible Bajaj is on a heavier side and fins are of good quality.Though I received 2 defective Bajaj heater physical dent on body from cloudtail I have again ordered the same. Hope this time it turns out to be good.No company is providing the details of the oil quality used in their product. Good luck. I have used bajaj oil filled heater before. This feels more sturdy. I think havells and borosil make the best quality oil filled heater in terms of sturdiness and finish. Although it s a simple assembly but still I wanted to buy a good brand as it draws a lot of power and I was concerned about safety.It makes the room warm quickly. Based on the power mode you choose. It will make the room dry. I have seen people using water vaporiser alongside but on low power I haven t felt too try in 1 2 hours of use.Overall since it was borosil I expected an even more beautiful look but since it works well I am happy. Easily 1.5 2 k costlier than its peers. Using 3rd Party off brand blowers for years I finally took the leap and bought the 13 fin Volcano from Borosil. It has transformed the way with its reliability and efficiency.Packaging:The item was secured and packed very well with amazon packaging along with the original Borosil Packaging.Assembly:Using the provided guidebook was easy to understand. The unit comes as assembled but you have to attach the castor wheels which was pretty easy. Then all was left was to plug it in.Usage:The heater warmed up the 20ftx20ft room with relative ease. It has 3 power levels for the fan attached and a temperature regulator. The heater takes 5 6 minutes to heat up and bring the room up to temperature.Looks:The product looks very well and the black fin structure helps meld well with any decor you have in your room.Additionally the two year warranty and the safety features make it a must buy product for winters.9/10 would buy again Did not give the expected result Ordered this OFR a month ago and have had used it since then. It is a powerful product to warm up the room pretty quickly. Although the first few minutes are slow but then it picks up the pace and evenly heats up the entire room. It is quite and doesn t even vibrate. I already own an OTG and an egg boiler and now the OFR. Borosil has stood up to the mark providing good quality appliances at a decent price tag.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41qqrzjPySL.

Sai Deepak Velivela Rajiv Das Ashok kumar Vishal kandare Gaurav Pachauri,Best for small Family The Gyser warms up water very quickly but does not hold hot water for long It s good Not up to the mark One day delivery and installation... excellent service Waranty card not found Good,I have been using this Geyser for almost two months. it heats up the water in just 15 minutes and quite power efficient. Uses almost half a unit for two person. And if you leave it on for the whole day its around 1 unit. Very power efficient. And looks stylish in the bathroom and due to the form factor doest take much space. Go for it . You get all the pipes and Installation material in the box so no need to buy them separately which is the case in some other models. I had 2 option while purchasing this geyser Havells vs this one. I opted this one as this was cheaper then its Havell s counterpart but this geyser does not satisfies me at all. The only PROS is its heats up water very quickly but rest is all CONS.I keep the know to maximum temperature but still the light does not move from orange to red even if I put on the geyser for 3 hrs. It does not holds hot water for long. I have used Recold AO Smith even Amica earlier they were not as quick as Crompton but they used to hold hot water for long. I have another Havells at home whose light goes from green to orange to red to display water temperature. Paisa wasul hai The product is not that good just given 5 star energy efficient but it takes more time to heat the water also don t holds hot water for atleast 6 hrs. Temperature control also not so good after getting 2 3 liters itself water becomes cold even if it is on from 20 min I m using ao smith geyser in our one room from five years no issue again purchased 2 geysers for other two rooms one is ao smith and other is this crompton even though i spend more for this geyser I m not satisfied. Better go for ao smith or racold.. Waranty card are missing. 8 Good product using since 2 months working properly,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/31kbrfC16XL.

GOOD PRODUCT Review Good quality Short cord and narrow mouth.,My only concern is longevity so let s see how long this one lasts. Otherwise it s quite quite useful especially during winters. Good looking but light weight. Not easy to clean. Nice product I bought this as it is made in india. It is light weight which is good and does its job well. The lid must be manually opened and must be pushed all the way up to hold. Initially it fell back but it needs to be push back to hold upright position.Am happy with itafter using it for two days. Except for the cord length of the kettle which should be a bit more.Otherwise THANK YOU FOR A GOOD PRODUCT. Very nice Good working Heats well less noisy and looks elegant. Cord is short and partially opening lid makes it difficult to clean. Has worked well so far.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/41RI hzCnvL.

Pramesh PrashantM777 Vajrapu lakshmy taruwn Kish Kusha Sahoo,Overall its good product Heater is Slow Small but useful Average product quality Working Good just missing temprature Controller. Nice quality Good looking and tests patience Good product with affodable price,Good product and superb fast heating.As it was small tank if u need to get bucket water1. On geyser and wait till water gets heated 2 3mins ON TAP and fill bucket with hot water.2. OFF TAP and wait for another round of water heating then again fill bucket and leave the tap ON untill bucket filled with warm water.3. If u need more hot water repeat steps 1 2.Cons: 1. One need to purchase inlet outlet pipes which costs around 400 as this was not provided by orient.Writing review after 20 days usuage. Heater is so slow as compare to Bajaj heater ... currently i purchased this 1 but it s not good I have ordered two of them . Installed in bathroom as well . There is a trick to use it in bathroom. Either turn tap really slowly or by turning on tap at full sppeed. Whenever the the water get cold again switch of the tap after 3 to 5 minutes again on and fill. Just this compromise you have to make in place of storage geysers. Product body fitting is average. Be prepared to spend another 600 700 R s. on installation pipes 16A plug and installation charges. No installation plate with geyser. To be mounted on screws. No safety valve supplied with geyser. Overall average product. Better go for Havells which comes with all accessories. Easy to install.Temprature controller is not available with this product..Till date working good. https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/51IzGNDZ7eL. SY88.jpg Ordered on 7th feb 2021. Received as per delivery date. On opening found that the unit is wrapped with plastic and found water droplets. Maybe they tested the product before delivery. Coming to the product it heats water to boiling temp in 3 4 minutes and you can expect 4 jugs of hot water only.Delivery:5/5Packing:1/5 since no bubble wrap or anything to protect the product.Product:3/5 you should not design a product with such low capacity now I am struck after buyingLooks:5/5Will update more later... First of all this is not a storage geyser. this is instant water heater. So better to understand the feature before using it. Just switch it on and wait for 1 2 min. it will start supplying hot water . As i told this is not a Storage geyser like 5 25 Ltr. It comes with 3lts capacity only with 3KVA. So once the set temperature reach . Then Open the Hot water TAP in normal/Slow running speed .So that it will continue supplying Hot water/ warm water. If the Hot water Tap will be fully opened with full speed then this instant water water will not get sufficient time to warm the water. Hope this review will be helpful.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/21vWJo4CXKL.

Very poor quality Good Good product but durability has come down over the period of time. Great quick delivery. New product and very reasonable cost Good product from eureka forbes ... Worst external packing from Amazon delivery,Though I bought a pack of two after seeing the pictures and checking model I received only one compatible with my Aquasure the other is different and not compatible with my unit. So essentially my money for the other is wasted because the return window was over. Using product regularly Easy to install. Poor quality doesn t stay more than 1 month it s kinda duplicate.it is available in 300 rs in CSD but it s not available there. That s why we choose to buy it online.but it s duplicate and very expensive. Hence Not satisfied.give the address where we can buy it offline/online also what s the warranty of this product mention it . Good It s easy to use. Installation is difficult if you don t or can t understand the fitting procedure but once you do A Okay and super easy.IMPORTANT : Lasts me well over 3 months but i recommend changing it after you think the flow of water has slowed down a lot OR you think the water tastes funny.For the last few days of its life the water will not be completely pure and it won t completely stop.This filter has a good water flow rate for a family of four it disperses enough water fast within 30 minutes you ll have several liters of water to drink.Also the main thing about this is it is CHEMICAL FREE it also filters out VIRUSES take a look at WHO recommendation. If you fold a cloth ten times over and pour water over it it can filter out cholera virus I would recommend this to all home owners. Since i got this cartridge delivery i didn t need to run to the store. Really liked the product..... But amazon packing is really made me disappointed... Really broken a trust on Amazon..... Filter kits were completely separated from the box cause the external box was too small and made the filter kits squeeze completely... I just pulled the filter kits to get it s normal size.... Please amazon don t do this kind of weird packing.. Atleast pack in a approximate box not this kind of flat huge box...... Thank you,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41WfA7FDnzL.

Good Amazing product it s worth buying Temperature of heating Either HOT or COLD not mixed water. Worthless item Great product Purpose is not fully served,I installed it myself in my kitchen and it is very useful. Good Heating of water good. But water become so hot u can t put your hand in it if it mixes the cold or running water with the hot water it will be good. Or water temperature can be adjusted it will be great. The product is very good. Easy to install and easy to use. The water spray jet is also good with movebale outlet.Water comes out either hot 60 degree centigrade or cold same like your water tank temperature .I thought I will getting mixed water as there is no provision of controlling the temperature always the water is more hot that you even cannot put your hand and if you bring the knob towards cold it immediately cools down so it is either hot or cold not both.Even if you slightly move the knob towards the hot side within 3 sec the temperature rises to 60degree centigrade from 30degree centigrade.Was expecting a reostat to control the temperature.Not able to use for the required purpose for kitchen. Pls do not purchase this items. water does not get hot at all. you reduce or increase water pressure. It s biggest weakness that there is no option to increase the temperature Or last one its price totally worth less. Wonderful product in this segment and value added product for home during winter The water gets extremely hot when given in hot mode and quickly gets cold when cold water option is switched.Ideal should be: like geyser it should have the option for both hot and cold water running parallelly so that a nice warm water flows and things get done.One cannot wash dishes with hand when water is very hot or very cold,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/41A6EmdtN8L.

Super,1. The steel quality could have been better but it is adequate.2. The second major problem is that neither the upper nor lower container has a handle and so when you try to open them after 15 minutes they are still hot making it difficult for children to operate it.3. The flavour depends on the coffee you use. We use genuine South Indian chennai made coffee bean powder so the aroma is fantastic but that has nothing to do with this particular product because any authentic filter coffee will have the best aroma.4. I can return the product very easily but for such small cost product that doing so would put the supplier in loss due to the cost of the return courier so even though it would be difficult to use without a handle I won t rather buy some better one.

The silver color is much better compared to stainless steel finish. Lov my coffee made in this This should be advertised as suited for 4 cups not 6. Does the job well and even after placing directly on the stove there is no discolouration. Steel quality is upto mark. I have been using this product for a while and have no complaints. Makes amazing filter coffee. Looks and quality are at par with other brands in its price bracket. In function this kind of a mokapot design is flawed at the cleaning aspect including this particular model in my observation. In it the pressured boiling water pushes through the coffee powder in bulk together thus rendering the flavour inferior to what is brewed otherwise when the water percolates little by little. Secondly the portafilter type coffee powder container positioned just above the boiler chamber sends some dissolved coffee back to the boiler water through the upward pressure pipe rendering the entire remainder water mixed with coffee go waste. Thirdly the coffee powder container s gasketted mesh is sedimented too while filtering the forced brew upward. So when a person like me thinks of preparing a brew in a mokapot like mechanism the very thought of the predicament of dismantling the the tiered chambers separating the gasket and then wash the pot thoroughly because coffee is lurking everywhere therein to cause unhygienic residues dampens my desire to go for it. I am no debater if the idea is to leave the pot just rinsed and washed and not rid it of the residues. All this is not the case with the downward filteration method of the other types of coffee machines that are absolutely unmessy. No offense meant for any system this is my personal opinion. I like the convenience of making coffee for 2 3 people in one go.Its very easy to clean it up after every use. Its rust free and looks beautiful while kept on kitchen counter even idly Like and good product Ordered this for my stay in India. it worked the way it should be it has silicone washers easy cleaning.

Coffee Filter Size Name: 2 Cups Human Interface Input: Unknown,Gautam B. Kabir Debbarma MS Amazon Customer P Sourav Basu Vikhyat G. Viren Dhamaskar,Meets expectation Good product High quality product Worth the spend Great product A decent filter coffee maker. Good product for an average user. High quality,An easy to use coffee filter at a reasonable price. Value for money fit and finish is good Good for 3 glasses of filter coffee. I am relishing the original filter coffee taste in North India. I give it 5 stars as it is the same as shown and good and easy to use. I mostly have instant coffee but this time I bought some filter coffee from Araku Valley during my visit. I was not aware of the process that you can t have it like the normal coffee so I tried it like normal one and it failed miserably because the coffee seeds won t get dissolved there is no coffee smell in it. Then I went online to understand the process where I came to know about this coffee maker. I bought it for 2cup coffee which cost me 299/ . You can get bigger one also for 4 or 6 cup. You can go through the process of how to make south Indian filter coffee online. To me it does job very efficiently and finally I am able to have a good cup of filter coffee. Now about the product it s not premium quality steel but it s a decent one and it s very easy to use. You fill the filter in morning and you can have the raw extract till night. So to me it s a value for money if you want to try filter coffee. The press doesn t work perfectly but does the job. Size is small you can only make one cup. The steel quality is world class. Gives a proper filteration,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41UGgTLOD4L.

Highly recommended Excellent quality Very frauding,3Kw huge consumption.rest is ok.and control is only by flow of water so you cannot set temprature and wastage of water is little more I have been using it since February 2022.Here are some points where it failed my expectations.1. The temperature doesn t remains constant not we can set it at a particular temp.2. The water flow is very restricted and takes more than 30 mins to fill the bucket of 15L completelyWhere as the geyser we used earlier bought from a local shop could be set at a particular temp as we can adjust in stove. And the water flow was also comparatively more faster than this. This instant electric water tap is awesome. This tap working properly by this seller.

Good product Good one got on a affordable price . Quality is good definitely would help for planning luggages for overseas travel. Nice cute scale ...looks good in kitchen . Does it s job perfectly Amazing product with perfect and accurate weights. I had seen an Amazon brand kitchen weighing scale and every time I was about to order it was out of stock and now that I found this I did no hesitate and ordered it for 749/ . I am sure if I had waited for some sale period I wud have got it for 500/ but didn t want to take a chance.As I ve checked the scale the following things are good1. Accuracy2. Tare function3. Light weight4. Ease to use5. Large backlit display6. Stainless steel baseWhat cud have been better1. A hook or a hole to hang it on the wall2. The weighing platform is slightly elevated from the base and possibly debris / rubble can stay in between where it s slightly difficult to clean with cloth will have to use some kind of small brush .Overall my recommendation is to blindly go for it and is really worth the price. Durability is yet to proven which only time / aging can prove.Thanks Amazon and Seller Dont go for 300 or 400rs product. If u gonna use it for long run more than 6month . This is the best product to buy. It works fine. Light weight. And accurate. 300rs product might show you incorrect reading like / 10gm and doesnt last more than 1 2month. IT IS WORKING WELL.

The length of the power cord is not sufficient. Easy to prepare sandwiches of any thick. It is a very good product. Decent cord length. The grill marks on my sandwiches and panini come out excellent. Value for money is good considering I bought this for INR 999 it s totally worth the spent. You can make one sandwich / panini at a time but I only cook for myself so I don t find any issue with that. But again it depends on the size of the sandwich. Go for it. Very Nice product ideal for small kitchen needs.. Very Light weight.. 1000w power capacity get heated very quickly... I say only one drawback powercord length is really very small it should be longer atleast 1.5 metre to 2 metre would be ideal...

Very delicate product Worth a buy Good product Just fine buy Good stickiness but bad handle,The only issue is that the built quality is very poor. It broke on 2nd use. Rest the adhesion is good. The product is not sturdy the handle broke after a weekThe adhesive is working but it is too diffuct to peel the tape Product is okay but the stick is very delicate so it broke now it very difficult to use the product. The handle of the product broke when I used it second time so it s very poor quality would not recommend. Its value for money Easy to use Product of good use. Wish the Handle of the roller was easy to use We have a beagle dog so we have extensive use of lint rollers in the household. Have been using the 3M but its very expensive if you consume 4to 5 rollers every month. So thought of trying this one as i though how bad can a lint roller be. The stickiness of the glue paper was good enough to remove the dog hair but the quality of the handle is really bad. It did not even last 2 days. So ended up using a wooden stick or long pencils for the job. If the makers had spent some more on making a good handle even if the cost would have been Rs 25 higher then it could have been a great product especially for those households which have pets as they need it more frequently. So i might go back to buying the 3M product of look for something in between.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41Fo2P8 4ZL.

Shraddha Sarwade messssi Vijay Ravindranath Sen Amazon Customer,Beautiful and functional but could be improved improvements written in review Agaro kettle Satisfied with the product A royal black beauty. Value for money. Agaro kettle review Review Good looking elegant easy to use,Everything is nice including design function works as intended and mostly as description. But here are things that couldimproved. the upper lid should be able to open up a bit more to the back if we want to wash it more thoroughly since having lid not open in a way that it goes a bit back enough for the lid to not feel a bit in the way its not as comfortable as it could be this shouldnt become a point which should make ppl avoid buying it though since many other models seem to open up till the same angle as this one does unless you found one that opens up more than this one if you already bought it or still want to buy it you can use a big bottle brush to scrub it even tho your hand can go in but you ll feel like you have to be more careful while Washing to not accidentally hit the lid you can see from my image/product image rest of the body seems sturdy but the handle feels a bit lighter than the body so it makes me wonder if handle would fall off due to daily strain when i pick up the kettle by handle alone may be it wont break/come off but i hold the kettle with both hands on both ends just in case to be safe : these are two things i d like to be improved if agaro makes any changes in the model features in future.I didnt return it though because chances are other models are the same or similar and apart from all that it works well.. So yeah. Very good kettle and big in size Cord length is good It is very robust in temperature control. That is to say on and off manual and automatic off. Regarding cord it is 1500 watts kettle which is on the top of ordinary Indian domestic non power 6A plug. They have given one meter quality wire with 6A plug. This means if your home wiring can stand 1500 watts on ordinary non power plug you can use it in any socket anywhere. The switch in the kettle is bit wobbly not sure whether it is purposely designed so: initially I was not pleased now love it because of majestic performance Product looks good. Value for money. seems good until now... hope will last long... good purchase Kettle is nice and cord length is also good but package is not good at the time of delivery it was opened,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/310R9iLp3mL.

I seep my grounds for around 3 4 minutes after heating the press for around a minute or so with hot water and am amazed at how heat resistant the glass is I would however still advise taking precautions. The markings inside also provide a great measurement of how many cups I would end up making. Not only have i used it for making coffee but also to froth milk and to make tea. Attaching photos of a coffee i made using this french press with a layer of frothed milk. Ngl one of the favorite purchases my family made am thoroughly pleased and highly recommend it to anyone. Time saving coffee/filter. Been using this for many months now and it s great. Love that it has line measurements. Only thing is I wish the top surface had an arrow type bump on the plastic to point where the holes are you so you don t have to look down but you can just tell by touch. Delivery: Amazon delivery is always reliable and it didn t fail me this time too..Packaging: Both outer packing and the product packaging were intact. Product packing had the right information and was very usefulProduct: Very compact. We used several coffee makers in the market but all required electricity to run. We wanted to have a non electric one which we can easily carry for outdoor and this one fits aptly to our requirements. Just add the coffee powder and hot water. After a while when we press the central pipe coffee comes out. The nozzle makes it convenient to pour it a cup.For this price in great India sale I think it s worth. I am inclined to give 5 star but reserving 1 star now. Will use it for a month and come back here to change my rating if it still satisfies me. Good one for a Black coffee lover Very very happy with Cafe JEI s French Press. It has become an important part of my daily ritual now in past 10 days. Easy to use and maintain and would recommend buying without hesitation. Instruction manual could have been a hard copy..too much steps to get the ebook Got this French Press last year and another one few days back One for Coffee another for Green / Black Tea.Totally value for money.

Good product not easy to clean Does the job very well Very nice sandwich maker Good quality and received on time Good Product i Recommend decent grill,Purchased this last month. It s good as working fine for me. Size is bit small but you can easily toast 2 normal breads at one go. Just make sure you fill same amount of stuff in both sandwich so that both gets heat properly from both side. Cord is bit small but it s good if you have plug near your kitchen. At first use it smells like wire is burning but after next usage that smell will not appear. Cleaning of the product is bit difficult as you can t wash directly under tap. You need to use clean cloth with wetted with water. You can use some liquid soap but make sure it gets cleaned with clean cloth. Apply some butter or ghee on both side of bread before making sandwiches else it will stick to your plates in grill. Overall good. It is Ok but does not look sturdy enough.The top and lower heaters are not parallel if the sandwich is a little thick.A little better design would have avoided this problem Makes the breads go crunchy from soft. 10/10 would recommend. Very nice easy to use except there is no temperature control knob . I like my sandwich more crisper Quality is good and easy to use received in 24 hours Product is Good i post review after 4 months from purchaseSufficient for 3 to 4 family memberI suggest go it easy to use and easy to clean.not bad at all.2 issues:1. the hook is on one side so if your sandwich is a bit bulky then the upper half may be tilted and loose on one side.2. the hook is also flimsy so there is a risk of breaking.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/51IMz58igdL.

Good product best in 5k segment ..,I like the price where it comes and the features it offers but one thing I din t like is its plastic fan can cover .The quality of the plastic used to give protection is very light due to which it can break easily so we have to carefully lift the product.

Easy to handle. Easy to clean. Can bill water as week as milk. Cord is little short. Steel quality is very good. you can buy Quality item I think that the thin plastic lid may get broken someday. You can t open the lid single handedly and it isn t easy to clean it due to its designer shape on the inside. Also I think the base coating will also fade soon. Normally after a few months of usage you can see the area of coil heating directly when water boils. In my case I can see that just a few days after purchase.Overall I wanted a 1L kettle with a big lid. So my major purpose was fulfilled.

Filling it once gives me around 3 nights full of cool vapour at around 50% setting.No complaints in using it for a week. Auto cutoff works are advertised. Usage is fairly simple and straightforward. Noiseless operation.A very minor observation:Tank is filled upside down and water is vapourised by a transducer in the bottom unit. This is fine but there s no mechanism to hold the tank and bottom unit together tank stands atop the bottom unit just like that. If you ve little kids who ll topple the tank this can be a concern.

Average product according to the price..little expensive Great for laundry storage Good product. Not much of a great product. Very poor quality Appears as a decent product Value for money,Not much durable cannot close proper Great for storage. The product is as advertised. Both sides of the bin tend to bulge out when clothes are inside. Hence the lid might often slip inside the bin. The both sides need some support to keep it sturdy so that the lid stays in it place. the material is flimsy and cardboard is not strong.. the side latch or handle stitched is not the strong. A box can t hold the weight when its full. Cheap price cheap value. Appears to be very weak may get damaged with in a few days of usage.Hence returned it. Too early to question its durability. However it looks sturdy. It is bit different from the product image as you can see in my pictures the entire top isn t designed as projected that s a bummer. Good for small families only.

Less heating Socket is loose.,The iron had water still inside it the plastic clips were half opened and the box looked like it was opened the Amazon box was intact . Just that product box was taped up . Expected to get a new product and not a renewed item .If I knew I was buying a renewed item I wouldn t have paid full price . Good product The product is good but not for steam iron. Water dripping outside of the iron box wetting the cloth. This product is easy to use as no problem of wire and works fine and take more time remove wrinkles 1 1380W is not enough for cordless design Quickly looses heat while usage takes time to re heat you often end up waiting for the unit to get reheated Corded Design is better for 1000W range models.2 Though this Has continuous steam option this drastically reduces the usable time and once you return the unit to base excessive water dripping issues can be noted. Condensed water flows down the base to the table 3 User manual does not cover all necessary details.Overall this is NOT a well designed product. Not happy with Real life usage nice product temperature drops down very fast Socket of the holding station seems loose. Sometime need to press down hard on the holding station.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T1/images/I/41YFjcEIwWL.

Amazon Customer Milind Barange Aniket Bhoir Roy J. RAGHU RAMA Sridhar S Sukhdeep Kaur,Works as expected but some things can improve I am using this more than 1 year Overall its a good product very useful.Some minor drawbacks. Great for vacuum bad for mopping Good product. Product service issues Good product A helping hand for working women,My review of using new Vacuum Mop Pro 2 for 3 days...1. The product is a bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow YouTube videos to get it setup. I wish Xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals. They don t mention it but we need Bluetooth and WiFi connection to be setup for the app and robot to work together. This tip is missing in user manual.2. WiFi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house. That time the robot needs to be brought back to the WiFi range. 5GHz connection does not work with this model.3. The robot takes anywhere between 40 60 minutes to completely vaccum my 800 sq. ft house. Battery life is really good in the new model. 50% or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house. Charging is also not bad. It took 1.5 hrs for it to charge full 100% the first time.4. Couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and I had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again. Once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times it would not repeat this behavior.5. Dusting is of A1 quality. Each time the amount of dust collected is staggering. We never knew we had so much dust in our house 6. Mopping is average. I would call it light wiping and not mopping. Hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping. Only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out. Adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or Vim liquid in the water helps.7. Vacuum Mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness. In this mode mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick up.I recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles.8. Keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house. This is not ideal. So it s important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping.9. The mop works horribly on door mats main door or bathroom mats . It gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place. So please remove all the mats esp. during mopping session.10. Noise levels are pretty low in medium mode. Sometimes we don t even know where it has gone it gets so quiet.Pros. Battery life Suction power Noise levels VacuumingCons Mopping is average. It s at best can be called as light wiping. Setup is bit tricky user manual is insufficient. Xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home. You have to figure it out using YouTube videos. I can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing. Once the device is confused it doesn t correct itself automatically. It needs a map reset. Door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before mopping.Such tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your own.But I still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house clean. ProsFor cleaning dust it is very good .we can set daily schedule.even if we forget to do so it will automatically does the work by setting schedule ...cleaning the box after its work is also not very hectic..brushes are providing..We can set restricted areas.ConesMost of the hairs n threads are stuck through the round main brush.. little difficult to clear the brush.It has been more than 1 year iam using this.One time the movement is low .when ichecked..so many hairs are stucked in its wheel.it was little difficult to clear the hair strands.Mopping it is average only..only takes very little amount of water.so oily things will remain in the floor..once or twice in week we have to do mopping with plenty of water and lizol..It can t reach the sharp corners also.Once we create restricted area..by the time of using it couldn t detect the proper area we marked..so it enter those area and get stuck most of the times.it is main thing I hate about this product..remaining things are okay....then we have to reset the map and set restricted area again..it is bit annoyingOverall it is very good for me...my brooming is almost completely replaced by this ...once in week I do the complete cleaning with broom to all areas that didn t covered by this machine .. In all other aspect like price battery app feature suction and cleaning its really very good product.I find it very useful and nice to have product.So will directly make note of some drawbacks/improvent area i observed.1 Sometimes it gets confused or leaves a specific section of bedroom even though there has been no obstacle.2 Its little noisy or I will say not a silent thing in standard suction power though that with any vaccuum cleaner.3 Xiaomi could have provides extra Hepa filter with it.4 vaccum mop doesn t clean properly and rather sticks dust to floor because of wet brush so I do vaccum and then only mop subsequently is best option.5 Charging is super slow if compared with any 5200mAh battery with mobile fast charger its 10 times slower despite such a big docking charger. I am a bachelor and i do not like Maid coming to my house.this solves the purpose. It is great at vacuuming my 2000 Sqft house. It can do it on turbo mode with dual cleaning in single battery life. was surprised with the vacuum power and battery life. It collects way more dust than the manual brooming.It can skip corners and narrow places. Once in a while i just broom the corners and bring the dust in the middle before turning the robot on.5/5 for navigation and room mapping.Mopping is equally bad. Mop does not cover whole area and it leaves trails. it leaves the floor looking worse than the un mopped floor. Also water tank broke in just few cleanings.Recommended for vacuuming purpose. Very good product. Very helpful product in my home. We purchased the product in April and now it is not working.After charging it is running for less than one minute and getting stopped Easy to use and Working well little bit of noise is there but acceptable. Helping hand. More reliable than maids. Does the job well. Once in 4 days you need to mop yourself. Good suction power.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/31grDt8hrBS.

Instructions are clear and easy to understand. Everything is fine but the power chord is too short only 50 60 cm length. No flexibility in the use of the machine in the kitchen or other place. Check if the power wirelength is sufficient for your use before you order. Awesome waffles are prepared should go for this Very nice product. Easy to make waffles. Easy to use . Worthit to buy. Amazing product worth each penny At the cost of 5 waffle one can get life time anytime waffle super easy to make waffle.Be careful for outer plastic body very fragile I made waffles for the first time. To make it crunchy ensure you don t fill in too much batter and also keep it for a little longer even after the light turns green. Keep an eye on it till u get a dark color of waffle ensure it doesn t burn . Good for household use. Easy to clean. Wire is a too short but it s manageable for me so I gave it 5 stars as it is as per my expectations. The waffle iron does not heat enough to make the waffles in the time indicated by either the light or the cooking time on the recipe. Tried it for the first time today. Let s see if it lasts.

Highly recommended for every household. Pros: Cord Length is good. Cross compatibility with Prestige Kettle Bottoms is nice. Initially didn t fit but started fitting over time as we sometimes use to put it on the Prestige Bottom out of ignorance. VolumeCons: Initially the water after heating use to have a smell. Some discoloration on the base of Kettle dark lining Disclaimer: I have used two kettles from Prestige which were also good enough but both of them burned out one of them within a year and has been sent for warranty claim. So I suppose it is in nature of Kettles to stop working after sufficient usage. Going to try KENT transparent one next time. Shi khel chal rha hai Kettles ke saath kya karen zarurat padti hi hai ghar pe V good product Overall a good product except the inside edges at the opening of the kettle is very sharp.... When you are cleaning it we have to be careful else it will cause a cut on the fingers It s not working after 6 months. Money waste Liked the kettle very much.Got the kettle today and its working fine.I liked the cord length its approximately 1.2meters long.The temperature knob works smooth i haven t felt big difference in low and high settings thoughThe lid is nice quality too and made of glass.Coming to the base it s good quality too.Instructions manual says this kettle can b used for making maggie for boiling eggs for brewing tea.And it says DON T USE THE KETTLE TO BOIL MILK ..... So therr you have it folks you can use this kettle for milk boiling and milk tea purpose.I found a little dent in the inner side on the base but its minute only so no worries says a little about quality control. But its not a trade of really.And just as any other stainless steel utensils get stains at the bottom on boiling water this one too.So my opinion use soft water and avoid hard water.And ohh forgot to mention there is a thermoplastic egg tray given with and easy carry stick that you have to assemble.Overall a good buy Nice product,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/414WPLTqm0L.

Can be used for both cold and hot milk. Batteries are sold separately 2 pcs LR6 AA 1.5V required. Two AA batteries should be placed in opposite direction in frother as in last image New Batteries are recommended to work efficiently,ANURAG Amazon Customer Pallavi Jaiswal Anshita Pooja Bhargava Manoj singh Akanksha Morpankh art gallery,Rechargable batteries do not fit correctly Okay product Great purchase. Average Fantastic Just buy it... Product is good for this price Happy That I didn t have to go to Hyderabad for IKEA.,While it makes enough froth under 1.5mins tested using amul taaza milk warmed at 50 60deg celcius the battery holder is too narrow for eneloop aa rechargeable batteries. I did not know this hence one of the batteries got stuck in battery compartment. Ultimately it had to be pried out by tweezers.Now that I have peeled the outer covers of my eneloops to slightly reduce the diameters I can insert and remove them. However I still cannot close the flimsy battery door. I have to hold and press it while operating it. Of course there is zero problem if you use costly duracells. Still the battery insertion process is not at all user friendly one has to watch youtube videos for that.To reduce spillage use tall coffee mugs while frothing. Not as strong and powerful to froth the coffee Quality is good. Average product Very easy to use house coffee looks like restaurant coffee too much frothy n worth it . This is the first time I m writing review about any product....this is the best frother at affordable cost Works well and the product is good for this price looks delicate and not sure of sturdiness though. Will updare for durability. Works good . Coffee making is faster.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/W/WEBP 402378 T2/images/I/21JwUdnWL4L.

The kettle heats efficiently and does exactly what it was designed to do and does it very well. Well worth the extra cost. Highly recommend. Excellent This is better than expected easy to use really fast nd above all its safe ....the length of the cord is okay if you have dedicated spot the vessel or else a half foot more will be better and comfortable.I can recommend this to all Wire length is very small Product quality is excellent. Using the same model for the past 4 yrs without any issues. We use it for boiling water. We boil the water for drinking and for making tea. We use the kettle atleast 5 or 6 times a day an twice in a day we boil water with its full capacity. So we boil water 1 or 2 cups to full capacity everyday.Recently the lid got detached so purchased a new one with the same capacity and model. To my surprise the kettle comes with bigger plug for which we don t have suitable socket. Hence returned the product and received refund promptly.There is no mention of the plug size in the product description. I give 5 star to the product and wish to buy again only if it is provided with 5/6A plug. Hope Philips takes note of this Advice: Please use it only for boiling water and there will be no trouble works for years The kettle opening is not so wide compared to some other makes but that will not be an issue if it used only for boiling water as intended. Chord length is less. Product is worth.,https://m.media amazon.com/images/I/41JyZuDzDgL.

Recommend it. But cleaning its exterior is cumbersome. Excellent product A good product for household use Best product Good,It does it job perfectly..only issue is temp control is not perfect . U need to keep checking the browness of sandwich untill it gets upto ur choise Product is good but the control knob is to be be modified cause after the cooking process completes the control knob should be return back to initial starting place. If not that process timer should be given basically. So think well what happens whether didn t had atleast one option.Not a indicator option. It is a nice product easy to use. The grilling function is also wonderful. But the exterior metallic finish picks up finger marks and other spots which tend to become permanent. Cleaning them is almost impossible. Very good product This is a pretty powerful sandwich maker for home use. The product looks good has a sturdy build and heats up quick. The sandwiches are made pretty quickly without burning.
